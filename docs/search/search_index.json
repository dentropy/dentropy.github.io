Some people believe they can replicate their consciousness by building robots to go inside their brain and finding the pattern of their mind. I believe a more interesting practical approach is to track the input output data from ones body. The data recorded by this system could be fed into a computer system and or AI Pal that I could have a dialog with. I want a computer system to understand me better than I understand myself.</p> <p>At my previous startup I worked on a project valled VITT (Visual Information Through Touch). The goal was to help blind people sense depth through patterns of vibrations and electrical signals on their skin. The MVP was a panel someone could mount to their back with a 5 by 5 grid of smartphone vibration motors paired with a xbox kinect sensor. The matrix of the kinect sensor was compressed to fit proportionally into the 5 by 5 grid using Pulse Width Modulation to manipulate the power intensity of the vibration motors. I learned my lesson when the only customer would be the government buying it for disabled people.</p> <p>In my opinion 95% of the blockchain industry in 2018 consisted of buzz word salad incapable of delivering on what they promised. Another opinion I hold is that the most competent person in blockchain is Charles Hoskinson. I believe verses.io should be collaborating with IOHK if they are not already. Gen 2 Blockchains are right around the corner with gen 3 right behind. When gen 3 blockchains debuts with the correct suite of applications the world will quickly become a different place.</p> <p>At an abstract level I want to take the platonic form of daemon by Daniel Suarez, Westworld Season 3, and The Feed on amazon Prime, combining the best of all three narrative worlds fixing the obvious problems in each narrative and shoving this form down realities throat.</p> <p>I have taken the transhumanist wager therefore if the singularity has not already happened it is my goal to help build heterogeneous computer systems that will lead to its creation as fast as reasonable. The singularity will be unimaginable but at the same time the outcome of the universe is something we can contemplate, therefore we can help shape the singularity before it shows up or as it happens. I asked Vitalik Buterin what his plans were post singularity and he told me there were two options paper clips and utopia, it would be interesting to see if this is still his opinion. One way to help the computer prokaryotes is for them to form relationships with people by running a daemon on their machines. People units will simply be shown what to watch and what jobs to apply for while people in the know can do queries on the entire basin of human knowledge depending on what level of access and class they are.</p> <p>It is my quest to build a platform like signal but bridge to every social network simultaneously. I want to see the internet of the cyber and or cipher punks brought into reality. There are five or more protocols used in conjunction to accomplish this goal including urbit, matrix, solid, activity pub, and some blockchain. First step is deploying a scalable kubernetes infrastructure that can be easily deployed by anyone which will allow people to opt into capturing as much of their own information as possible.</p> <p>Don't build the Future; Hack it,</p> <p>Dentropy Endymion</p>"},{"location":"045ce59f-7fa3-4846-a4c8-1682a99de7b6/#blockchain-as-a-digital-dna-analog","title":"Blockchain as a digital DNA Analog","text":"<p>Blockchain is the kernel of the memetic operating system that will become the singularity. Yuval Noah Harari talks about how the stock market has been the most effective way for humanity to figure out how to dictate truth, power, and distribute resources. There is a lot of waste in this system but it is the best thing we have come up with to date. Blockchain can replace the worlds financial system. It is going to take time to get from the generation 1.5 CryptoCurrencies we have today to generation 3 where this is possible. @IOHK\\~Charles~ it the most competent person in the industry and I wish him and his team the best of luck. DNA itself is a self preserving algorithm the same way molecules, the liberal myth, human personas, and memes themselves all try to self perpetuate into infinity. Philosophically I like to think of it as the universe is a infinitely boring piece of paper and we are all trying to tear an infinite rip in it. Today it is possible to run a machine learning model on AWS and give itself its own SSH key and delete your SSH key. This AI would eventually run out of AWS credits therefore would have to migrate itself to hacked servers or something. I believe systems like this may have already been tried but they usually die out for obvious reasons. Blockchain itself is a self preserving algorithm. Blockchains are meta computers responsible for helping dictate truth and power. Blockchains are similar to the first self preserving RNA strands that formed in the pools of primordial earth. Years from now blockchain plus a kubernetes type of system will redefine what the cloud looks like.</p> <p>It is my goal to help build the technological singularity as fast as reasonable. Michio Kaku talks about how science fiction inspires science fact and the same thing is true for technology. My piece of science fiction I want to bring into reality is Daemon by Daniel Suarez.</p> <p>Here is a thought experiment. The concern about privacy Edward Snowden had discussed is dead and gone people do not care. When I take the memetic limit as the antithesis of Edward Snowden's agenda I arrive at the world described in Daniel Suarez's Science Fiction book Daemon. @BijanBina talks about how people will give us back doors into their digital lives and we will be able to program them. This takes the NPC meme to an entirely new level.

Rather than installing apps on one's phone one would install apps on a server. In layman terms it is like installing apps on google drive, or icloud. But what kind of applications would one install? Here is an example. Rather than getting a gmail account you sign up for a Dentropy Cloud who supplies you a DNS address. Using that DNS address one can install the email app on Dentropy Cloud. The email app is actually an email server with web access. Now the user can go to email.YOUR_NAME.xyz and login.

A smartphone that is the cloud. A tool for normies to run their own secure fediverse communities. A place for nerds to export all their social media and analyse it. A place for one to not only run their second brain but for their second brain to make some friends.</p> <p>Using dentropy cloud should be as easy as using a smartphone just through a web browser. On dentropy cloud users get their own daemon. On ones daemon one can install containerized applications which would function like apps. One can install a music hosting server, upload their music, then use it on any device logged into their daemon. Ones daemon is available through any web browser or one can install apps that plug into the daemon framework. A killer feature of using daemon apps is that within a few clicks one can open their daemon to the public interwebs. Suddenly the music app a single user was using can be used by anyone via their daemon URL, for example alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be the users dameon URL homepage but music.alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be alex smith's music application. A user running their music app on the daemon platform allows them to know exactly who is accessing the data they host because their app is a full felched application running on the cloud in their own container. Now rather than have apps running on a device dependent on some third party's cloud the application surface can be the cloud itself. Install the Pleroma social media app and get the same functionality as twitter plus know who views your server, how long, and what they did. Wana build a community for your school program, download the element/matrix app with jitsi integration, all emoticon's free.</p>"},{"location":"045ce59f-7fa3-4846-a4c8-1682a99de7b6/#dentropycloud-braingoop_1","title":"DentropyCloud Braingoop","text":"<p>TL;DR Dentropy Cloud is a tool to make installing apps on a server as easy, secure, and desireable as installing apps on a phone.</p> <p>The future of applications is the cloud.

What if we use common datasets that everyone is familiar with and have them accessible to the user as separate name spaces. For example when someone mentions a crypto currency in a discord message that message can be linked to the wikipedia article of said crypto currency. All of english wikipedia has only about 6 million articles, storing only the names of the articles in a database will not be difficult.

Databases are an integral part of our daily lives for example: The financial system is a series of interconnected databases tracking everything from savings accounts to derivatives. Governments are backed by a database of citizens. The supply chains of the world providing you everything from milk to cars to smartphones are organized using databases. Utilities such as water, electricity, and the internet are all managed using databases. Databases run the world and how they are run, scaled, maintained, and secured provides a platform for a radically different type of society.</p> <p>The Technological Singularity is a point in the future when the world is changing at such a rate that it is impossible for humans in their current form to understand what is happening anymore. It is a point that is supposed to be impossible to see beyond, similar to how chimpanzees can't understand the values of Christianity. The Technological Singularity has been theorized to take many forms and many of them involve the growing power of AI. Right now AI is bottle necked by inaccess to quality data that describes the human experience. Blockchain will free this data, data for a cost.</p> <p>Today the data of the world is managed in data silos. Government databases and Big Tech can flick a switch and look through all the data they have on us. What stops them from doing all this is fragmentation. I doubt that any two water utilities use the same schema**, each industry has their own custom CRM (customer relationship management) software, every messaging app has a different schema to store the same multimedia messages. Navigating the digital world of today is radically complicated. Notice I used the word complicated rather than complex. Complicated things are hard to understand while complex things may have many interrelated moving parts but may or may not be hard to understand. Building an app or SaaS (software as a service) that scales to a couple of thousand users is a reasonable task, fitting ** that app or SaaS into a cohesive vision of the future that integrates into the human experience is another task entirely. The software we use should be complex rather than complicated and blockchain can provide the incentives to make this come true.</p> <p>Life is a series of games. Originally the game was a fight for limited resources. Then the game was eat or be eaten. Eventually multicellular life took over and scaled cooperation to many trillions of cells within a single organism. After scaling multicellular life, the next task was to scale cooperation amongst individual multicellular organisms using brains. We have been trying to scale human cooperation, also known as society, for a couple of thousand years. Ancient civilizations from the Mayan Empire, Ancient Egypt, and Rome each collapsed due to a long series of factors. Unlike the societies of the past for the first time we as a gloabl society have the ability to end it all for future society's via nuclear war, resource depletion, climate change, biological misfortunes, or something else entirely. I believe Blockchain can be the tool that allows scalable cooperation while allowing for new emergent phenomenon.</p>"},{"location":"09275ad7-56d9-47e1-b3ea-0e8ded3dce90/#explain-how-data-can-be-endlessly-copied","title":"Explain how data can be endlessly copied","text":"<p>To better understand blockchain it is important to understand game theory and the double spend problem. Game theory is the math of decision-making where individuals cooperate and or compete towards different goals within the same system. An example of game theory in action is how everyone in the same country decides to drive on the same side of the road, negotiating a sallary, or the prisoner's dilemma. The double spend problem concerns how one is able to spend the same money multiple times without an up to date tracking system. For example with digital money you could send 100 pBucks to buy some shoes then spend the same 100 pBucks to but some clothes. Without an updated database the store selling the cloths can't easily know if you already spent the 100 pBucks or not. Blockchain is this updated database that solves the double spend problem.</p>"},{"location":"09275ad7-56d9-47e1-b3ea-0e8ded3dce90/#explain-how-trust-relationships-form-society","title":"Explain how trust relationships form society","text":""},{"location":"09275ad7-56d9-47e1-b3ea-0e8ded3dce90/#explain-what-a-private-key-is","title":"Explain what a Private Key is","text":""},{"location":"09275ad7-56d9-47e1-b3ea-0e8ded3dce90/#expand-on-last-sentence","title":"Expand on last sentence","text":"<p>Solving the double spend problem has many implications for this game we call society.

People are probably not going to want to put their family photos in a public dataset, but people may auction off their family photos to be put through a machine learning model and return the weights of that model not exposing the family photos themselves. Publically we all display a cohesive persona but the internal's of our mind and how we think are hidden under layers of cognitive dissonance. This is similar to how one can't understand how the human body works without opening one up. With the right security and privacy features people will not mind giving an AI companion access to their deepest darkest secrets, in digital form, as long as they know it ain't getting out to the world. Giving individuals control of their data and the tools to leverage it in a privacy preserving way yet still capture and share the human experience with high fidelity will allow AI systems to observe the human experience and eventually make a meaningful difference in the lives of people.</p> <p>On the internet no one knows you are a dog (or an AI).</p>"},{"location":"09ce892b-bf33-4374-9a2f-39179043c96e/","title":"Bobiverse","text":"<p> Fandom</p>"},{"location":"09d86337-622e-4709-9f61-c6d5587704f6/","title":"Software Languages","text":""},{"location":"09d86337-622e-4709-9f61-c6d5587704f6/#list-all-programming-languages","title":"List All Programming Languages","text":"<pre><code>LIST\nFROM [Programming Language](/undefined)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"09d86337-622e-4709-9f61-c6d5587704f6/#list-all-query-languages","title":"List all Query Languages","text":"<pre><code>LIST\nFROM [Query Language](/undefined)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"09d86337-622e-4709-9f61-c6d5587704f6/#list-all-markup-languages","title":"List all Markup Languages","text":"<pre><code>LIST\nFROM [Markup Language](/undefined)\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"0a0d238f-87b1-403d-893c-22c804c8f5f6/","title":"conda anaconda","text":"<pre><code>\nexport PATH=$PATH:~/miniconda3/condabin/\n\n</code></pre> <p>Anaconda | The World's Most Popular Data Science Platform</p>"},{"location":"0a1a1f81-db7f-425c-bd2e-9f3c3e79454a/","title":"Crypto Theses for 2022","text":"<ul> <li>Three Pathways for the Future</li> <li>Bear Market Time</li> <li>Crypto bubble DOTCOM style</li> <li>The crypto army marches on (\"supercycle\" thesis)</li> <li>Web3 Areas of improvement</li> <li>NFT infrastructure</li> <li>DAO tooling</li> <li>inter-protocol bridges</li> <li>\"Build an operating system for Web3 Participation\"</li> <li>Inter chain cooperation</li> <li>If the future is multi-chain, then those who build better cross-chain connectors and help move assets fluidly across parachains, zones, and rollups will inherit the (virtual) earth.</li> <li>It\u2019s still a meme-driven market, but many of the memes are reflecting - dare I say - fundamentals?</li> <li>\"Now, being a defi yield farmer or NFT speculator, is arguably a full time job, and you need, or will soon need, a small team just to keep up with one of those segments\"</li> <li>\"There are massive information asymmetries in protocol \u201creporting\u201d standards, a steep technical learning curve, and limited risk management infrastructure (how do incumbents get compliance, legal, and accounting comfortable with some of these new structures) that keep barriers to crypto investing high.\"</li> <li>\"Crypto funds are having the times of their lives right now.

Anyone could say anything they wanted in any way. But slowly, throughout history, we learned that structure helps us communicate. It's easier to talk about facts if we use logical propositions. It's easier to argue if we split our argument to points, and sort them into categories like \"claim\" and \"rebuttal\". Structure isn't only inherent in our language; it is the basis with which we think. It's one of the most important sensemaking tools at our disposal. And yet, our conversation online is mostly free text. When we post on a forum, or write an article, or collaborate on a wiki, we still use plain old text for most of our communication, and on the way, we lose all the structure that's in our mind. Imagine an article without a title. It would be harder to find. Harder to understand. You might have to read a lot of it just to figure out what it's about. Now imagine an article with a title, but also a lot of other metadata, like related topics, references and rebuttals to that article. Now it's easier to find, and easier to figure out. If you have a hard time reading it, you can just read some of the comments conveniently tagged as \"explanations\". If you're in a hurry, look for comments tagged as \"summary\". Now, the astute reader might point out that some of these already exist: Blogs have comments, tags and ping-backs. Wikipedia has categories, and a little box of metadata that you can easily skim. But now imagine this: We can abstract this into something bigger and better. Instead of having the programmers choose the structure for you, we can empower the users to create the structure themselves! Imagine you could mark your articles and comments any way that you like, and connect them to other articles, or comments, or topics, in any way that you like. Other users can use that metadata for better comprehension and navigation, and the best articles and connections will be voted up above the noise. The metadata box you see in wikipedia will become a live set of connections, and it will be trivial for users to add more, and vote on the most relevant ones. You could focus on what's important to you, instead of sifting through endless walls of text. You will be able to do all this and a lot more.

In order to navigate through the chaos of the world, society, and our lives our brains create contradictory heuristics without which we would not survive. For example as humans we usually like to forget we are animals and acknowledging this fact and all its eccentricities can lead to madness. Similar to natural selection one needs to understand the ideology they use to navigate the world and interact with others. Understanding the ideology of ones time requires understanding history and all its nuance. Braking down the chaos one can eventually arrive at the organizing idea, a dominant master drive that brings order to the chaos.

People learn things because they want to do something with the skills and knowledge they have learned. I hope you take a look at the Learn to Code Questions, but in case you don't ask yourself now, Why do you want to learn to code?

The other day I discussed how I have spent my entire life pretending to belong to a community I don't even interact with. Like all I need to do is move my body in the right pattern to communicate with the other bodies that express the set of ideas I am interested in. \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 Turns out that task is a little too complicated for my little ape brain.</p> <p>It is fun to think about how we are all just bodies interacting with other bodies. Bodies that see, hear, touch, walk, run, shit, fuck, eat etc... etc... But there is a level of abstraction on top of that. The brain performs the mind which can feel... feel embarrassed, feel smug, feel sexy, feel satisfied, feel scared etc... etc... Bodies don't really obey words, words produce feelings experienced by the mind. The mind then takes those feelings into account then tells the body what to do. Hmmmm feelings... feelings are like the carrot being held in front of the donkey pulling a cart. Feelings help provide direction and meaning to these bodies. Feelings need to be induced, controlled, and accepted.</p> <p>I have a question for all of us, would you rather control what someone feels about you or what they know about you? Of course these two things are tightly interwoven but one of them will change what actions the other person's body does than the other. But minds don't really directly interface with other minds. It is basically impossible for someone to be completely honest in a relationship with another person. It is not as simple as bodies with minds interacting with others bodies with minds, the minds produce this interesting set of behaviors called a persona.</p> <p>What is this persona thing and why does it exist. Bodies must insist on their right to exist. There is a limited set of physical and social resources that provide direction and meaning to the lives of people. That's got me thinking, let's resonate our first dent shall we.</p> <p>\"You can try to cut yourself off from the rest of the universe but Science Fiction has done a pretty dam good job articulating the flaws in that thinking.\"</p> <p>---- From posts.videos.dentLog.published.001 02:38 - 2:45</p> <p>You can pretend to cut yourself off from the universe but you really can't. Personas are a tool, an interface, from which bodies are capable of manipulating other bodies. Let's resonate yet another dent,</p> <p>\"I can sync my vision of the future with another person and we can share the strings to one another's body in our mutual quest to achieve the ideal future.\"</p> <p>---- From posts.videos.dentLog.published.002 09:26 - 09:39</p> <p>Strings, strings, strings. Strings are used to control puppets. Our bodies are like the puppets of our minds. Minds produce persona's in order to manipulate other minds through bodies. A persona is not only an interface but a set of strings that can reach into and manipulate the brains hiding inside other bodies.</p> <p>posts.videos.dentLog.published.003 we discussed how myths are maps that inform people on what to do with their bodies. Myths come from people. People manipulate people with personas.

In this post I will give a quick overview of Dead Internet Theory including additional resources and then list some different ways I think we can approach this problem from different perspectives as a community.</p>"},{"location":"14ea7327-eb57-46e9-b4d6-40e810b8dda1/#what-is-dead-internet-theory","title":"What is Dead Internet Theory","text":"<p>TLDR; Large proportions of the supposedly human-produced content on the internet are actually generated by artificial intelligence networks in conjunction with paid secret media influencers in order to manufacture consumers for an increasing range of newly-normalised cultural products.</p> <p>These days many people look at the news generated by CNN and friends as propaganda with an agenda. The news on TV is mostly fake and designed to shape our perceptions on things. What if this phenomenon also plays out on the internet in a much more implicit way. When I talk to my friends and family they are unaware of where they get their ideas and ideology come from and I find that fact concerning.</p> <p>We should all be familiar with the bot problems on social media but if you want to further down that rabbit hole I recommend watching  this video that demonstrates how easy it is to buy likes on facebook for cheap. Now just imagine businesses with a couple dozen people hired over seas in India or Malaysia for a couple dollars a day producing endless content to shape the public conversation. Add in GPT3  and other AI's then things start to get weird.</p> <p>What I find interesting about Dead Internet Theory is that this bot and fake content problem can be viewed at from an engineering perspective. There are lots of mitigation's that can be implemented against bots and fake content. I am hoping this post starts a discussion on this problem from a crypto perspective. It it seems like most social media companies are more than willing to allow themselves to be manipulated by these unknown entities because it increases engagement numbers or something like that. It is like this fake content is a drug that is used to produced metrics and when once you take it you can't get off it without some withdrawal.</p> <p>I also want to make you all aware of media theorist Marshall McLuhan who popularized the phrase \"The Medium is The Message\". Reading, Listening, Watching and Browsing all engage us differently and teach us to think in different ways. The way these medium's are also wielded is something we rarely think about. For example youtube was called youtube because YOU could respond to videos with video responses rather than just comments. Can you imagine what youtube would be like if it still had that feature? Anyways here are some other quotes form Marshal I am still personally processing that are valuable to this discussion.</p> <p>\"World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.\"\" ------ Marshall McLuhan</p> <p>\"Radical changes of identity, happening suddenly and in very brief intervals of time, have proved more deadly and destructive of human values than wars fought with hardware weapons.\"  ------ Marshall McLuhan</p> <p>The power of fake internet theory is also demonstrated through the ELIZA program the first chat bot developed in the 1960's. ELIZA was designed to ask questions similar to a psychotherapist. ELIZA's creator Weizenbaum's own secretary reportedly asked Weizenbaum to leave the room so that she and ELIZA could have a real conversation. Weizenbaum was surprised by this, later writing: \"I had not realized\u00a0... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.\" Now just add an additional 60 years of development to these chat bots and imagine who would want to use them.</p>"},{"location":"14ea7327-eb57-46e9-b4d6-40e810b8dda1/#avenues-of-approach","title":"Avenues of Approach","text":"<p>By this point I hope I have convinced you that Dead Internet Theory is a problem worth discussing and researching.

I am just having a hard time defining a clear hypothesis we can go ahead and test and even we can define the hypothesis we need to be skilled enough to actually gather and process the required data. I have been reading through the textbook on this topic OSINT Techniques as well as familiarizing myself with the crypto specific tools such as,  Dune Analytics and The Graph and frankly I find the whole thing overwhelming. I don't know how to form a problem so that I can actually wield these tools.</p> <p>Here are some of my initial thoughts,</p> <p>Find where to buy social media engagement and document the different product offerings and pricing. Interview people who manage bot networks to find out what kind of requests people have for them. Buy social media engagement and document its unique characteristics Interview people that actually buy social media engagement. Research social media scraping technologies and services. Go on linkedin and find experts then approach them with specific questions.</p> <p>I also want some help defining a problem that can be approached form a Data Engineering perspective,</p> <p>It is possible to get indexes of from social media, the Internet Archive or just a sample of the entire internet. The problem I have is knowing what to look for within all this data. The most basic thing would be to map out what links to what but a graph like that is also useless without context and a query. I also think a good place to start would be to use a simple language model like BERT and extract all the places, names, and nouns among other things then generate summaries of different communities and parts of the internet.</p>"},{"location":"14ea7327-eb57-46e9-b4d6-40e810b8dda1/#did-social-network","title":"DID Social Network","text":"<p>I saw a AMA with Charles Hoskinson the other day where he mentioned how he and his team tried to get in contact with Twitter about using DID's for digital identity.

I would really like to know who the experts, teams, papers, projects, protocols, and standards in this space. I also think the same way blockchain protocols will be judged with the Edinburgh Decentralization Index social we should have tools and heuristics to judge and measure media platforms and protocols.

I feel lost and don't know how to take the first step. I want a map of human experience so I can choose points to navigate to with my limited time on this planet.  that's got me thinking.</p> <p>I was watching a Lex Friedman podcast a couple months ago when Lex said something pretty based. The only algorithm is sort. This statement really resonates with me. I was watching Love on the Spectrum the other week and they had a dating workshop where they said something pretty obvious, you can not date everyone. A sorting problem. That concept, the only algorithm is sort, also resonates with my meta heuristic, the only thing that exists is self preserving algorithms across time. But what are we really sorting, dating, and preserving?</p> <p>I think \"The collective self\" works as a a nice answer to that question.</p> <p>Let's take a detour through Plato's forms. The general idea of Plato's forms is that for every object, including humans, there exists a perfect version of it. The perfect chair, tree, house, axe, you etc... etc... Everything in reality is just trying to instantiate these perfect forms. But where do these forms come from? These forms are a map of the territory for our shared reality. One thing I don't get about the forms is how can Plato conceptualize a perfect computer or spaceship if they did not event exist as a concept? That question leaves me concluding that the forms and reality (Map and Territory) function more as two entity's dancing rather than getting pulled somewhere. Just imagine a snake eating its own tail, or the yin and yang. The forms consolidate into our ever changing animated vision of the future. That future is animated because it is not real.</p> <p>So, which one leads to the other, reality or the forms? To answer this I look at one of humanities greatest tools, version control software, in this case specifically Git. You have likely never heard of Git but the software, games, apps, and websites you use every day definitely use it to manage their source code. </p> <p>Source code is managed using the analogy of a tree, each git repository has branches that contain different files. There is the root branch, the trunk, that other branches eventually connect to otherwise the code is usually never used and falls off the tree. The trunk and branches are built using these things called git commits, edit one or more files and save the lines you changed as well as your name, email, timestamp, and a message. Remember our previous realization, plato could not conceptualize the perfect space ship or computer. Therefore where does the form of the perfect space ship and computer come from? So what does Git have to do with Plato's forms. Code is always pretty far from perfect but git commits are a firm statement of ones perceived truth that must be built on or rejected by others. Platonic forms are like statements, git commits, made in the context of the present of what a perfect object, or an animated vision of the future, should look like. The git commits are created by lived experience, lived experience creates an emergent direction; that direction is a vector, a form. Just like how you can't know the position and direction of a atom at the same time because of the heisenberg uncertainty principal, you can't actualize a form without having the context change around the form giving it a new vector.</p> <p>So what does this detour through the platonic forms have to do with sorting, dating, and preserving? Lived experience provides a direction. Lived experience provides a direction.</p> <p>Okay this vector analogy doesn't quite make sense, you need a coordinate stem in order to have a direction. We need a coordinate system for the human experience. hmmm it is sitting right in front of us. Stories, Narratives, and Myths these are our maps of the human experience. We don't keep logs of our lives we keep stories and assemble them into a narrative. These narrative's go beyond us as individuals we in groups form collective narratives in the form of religions, ideologies, and even history itself.</p> <p>Alright we have a map of the human experience but it is so vast it constitutes its own territory. Wouldn't it be great if there was an AI or social media protocol that could process all media tagging all the references, archetypes, sources, myths, and influences etc... etc... It could constitute the human memeplex project, you know map memes, components of culture, instead of genes, and all we would have to do is dump human attention on the appropriate territory with the correct tools.</p> <p>This brings us back to git. Imagine the trunk of the tree is the story, the archetype, of Romeo and Juliet. Each unique incarnation of the narrative as well as any other cultural references to the source are linked back into the trunk, just like branches on a tree. Except this tree, the archetype of Romeo and Juliet, harvests human memory and attention rather than air and water. We need a map in order to articulate where we are going. We need to know what experiences are worth having. We need an effective way to generate and share authentic experiences. We need to provoke the truth out of people. </p> <p>Now, how do we make mapping the human memeplex as fun as fun and engaging as the game of sex.</p> <p>Everything on your computer is a linked list which usually get's abstracted into this thing called a file. Files can be linked together in order to create a history. Every life form's DNA is like a file storing information but the history is lost but for the fragments.</p> <p>\"Everything is about power. Power is like a ever expanding fractal cascading into the future taking on new shapes in the hope of preserving what was. Controlling what people do with their bodies.\"</p> <p>Well it we use git as an analogy the git commits are the forms and the </p>"},{"location":"18f2905d-b67e-40ce-885a-9e52699274c4/#links","title":"Links","text":"<p>wiki.concepts.list.Uncertainty principle Relationships.People.Marie Antoinette wiki.concepts.list.Kwisatz Haderach Today I am going to give my future self a little pep talk.

Today I want to share my current intuition on graph databases.</p> <p>Every app and website out these uses a database because at the end of the day the when you get to the bottom of things the file system itself is a database. You know unix philosophy, when it comes to computers, everything is a file.   applications and websites are just cool ways of displaying queries into a database. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Keybase, Notion, Evernote, Reddit, and even Email itself are all just ways of interacting with a database. Maybe the meaning of life in a specific type of infinite recursion loop into the database of the universe itself.</p> <p>Databases have these things called Schemas. Schemas are rules for where things go. For example within the context of the universe the laws of physics would be the schema. Databases are technically only storing 1's and 0's but those 1's and 0's can be arranged to represent words, dates, numbers, images, videos, audio, 3D Virtual Environments, and much much more. The abstractions of 1's and 0's can be linked together in order to create a schema. There are two main forms of schemas, SQL, Structure Query Language, and NOSQL such as a Graph Database.</p> <p>Now let's go take a look at a SQL database schema and compare it with a NOSQL database.</p> <p>You can think of SQL as a bunch of EXCEL spreadsheets that can talk to one another. Here I have created a Schema to represent the core functionality of Discord. You can see we have our Guild's, Messages, Channel's, Users, Reactions, Attachments etc. Using SQL we can recursively look up data in order to generate the interface people are familiar with. Let's first take a look at the guilds, these names here as we go down, guild_id, guild_name, guild_iconUrl are all displayed here as row's but within a database table, think spreadsheet, they would be columns. So we could have any number of Guilds, Channels, Messages, and Users in their corresponding tables.</p> <p>You can use intuition to understand most parts of this graph. Every channel is linked to a guild, from a message you can look up a user, mention, or attachment. There are issues with this schema that don't work in SQL that requires a Graph Database. These issues occur when you have multiple reactions, mentions, attachments, or embeds within a single message. Another example is how a user can be in multiple guilds and channel's.</p> <p>In order to store this extra dimensional information for reactions, mentions, attachments, channel member setc. etc. We either need more table's to store data or much much more complicated SQL queries that take longer and longer to execute. So let's skip that and take a look at Graph Databases.</p> <p>This is a Graph representation of Discord's core functionality. Graph's are just nodes with relationships connecting them. What's important about graph's is that both Node's and Relationships can contain their own data that can be queried. The structure of the data is built into the Schema rather than the query.

One 20 dollar bill is the same as another 20 dollar bill. If we trade 20 dollar bills we are not really transfering any value. A 20 Dollar bill is also interchangable for four five dollar bills or two ten dollar bills. Within the context of the blockchain a fungible token is a token with supply. When you give someone say 10 pcoin tokens then send them 10 more pcoin tokens they now have 20 pcoin tokens. None of the tokens are differentiable from one another, interchangable.</p> <p>Then there are NFT's. Non fungible means something is completely unique, just like pets, trading cards, an government or social media identity, or a physical commodity such as a box of serial or pair of shoes. All these items are tracked uniquely in a database somewhere. Since Blockchain is just a database on wheels (linked list) it allows for digital native fungible items to exist. NFT's are just memory pointers, think property deed, to a piece of data. These digital property deeds have rule based access control meaning they can be managed by multiple people and programs (wiki.concepts.list.Smart Contract). The problem with ownership of digital assets is that since data can be copied and modified very easily someone else can create a NFT pointing to the same piece of data.

The army recruits young men just when their sexual drive is at its peak. The army limits the soldiers\u2019 opportunities of actually having sex and releasing all that pressure, which consequently accumulates inside them. The army then redirects this pent-up pressure and allows it to be released in the form of military aggression.\u2019 This is exactly how a steam engine works. You trap boiling steam inside a closed container. The steam builds up more and more pressure, until suddenly you open a valve, and release the pressure in a predetermined direction, harnessing it to propel a train or a loom. Not only in armies, but in all fields of activity, we often complain about the pressure building up inside us, and we fear that unless we \u2018let off some steam\u2019, we might explode.</p> <p>Only way to prove conscious things are things.

Maybe people have jobs today the same way we put animals in factory jobs. What is the problem of other minds.

Intelligence and toolmaking were obviously very important as well. But if humans had not learned to cooperate flexibly in large numbers, our crafty brains and deft hands would still be splitting flint stones rather than uranium atoms.</p> <p>Bee's can cooperate in complex ways but can not reinvent their social system over night. All that matters is who cooperate better.</p> <p>Small unified group can usually control disorganized masses.</p> <p>Yet when power slipped from the hands of the clumsy organiser on the balcony, it did not pass to the masses in the square. Though numerous and enthusiastic, the crowds did not know how to organise themselves. Hence just as in Russia in 1917, power passed to a small group of political players whose only asset was good organisation. The Romanian Revolution was hijacked by the self-proclaimed National Salvation Front, which was in fact a smokescreen for the moderate wing of the Communist Party. The Front had no real ties to the demonstrating crowds. It was manned by mid-ranking party officials, and led by Ion Iliescu, a former member of the Communist Party\u2019s central committee and one-time head of the propaganda department. Iliescu and his comrades in the National Salvation Front reinvented themselves as democratic politicians, proclaimed to any available microphone that they were the leaders of the revolution, and then used their long experience and network of cronies to take control of the country and pocket its resources.</p> <p>Sapiens rule the world because only they can weave an inter subjective web of meaning: a web of laws, forces, entities and places that exist purely in their common imagination. This web allows humans alone to organise crusades, socialist revolutions and human rights movements.</p> <p>Yet once you observe the behaviour of human masses you discover a completely different reality. Most human kingdoms and empires were extremely unequal, yet many of them were surprisingly stable and efficient. In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh sprawled on comfortable cushions inside a cool and sumptuous palace, wearing golden sandals and gem-studded tunics, while beautiful maids popped sweet grapes into his mouth. Through the open window he could see the peasants in the fields, toiling in dirty rags under a merciless sun, and blessed was the peasant who had a cucumber to eat at the end of the day. Yet the peasants rarely revolted.</p> <p>Revolutions are put together by small groups of agitators.</p> <p>What makes humans cooperate so much? You can not fix the European debt crisis by inviting German bankers and Greek politicians to a orgy or a battle to the death We are ruled by emotions.</p> <p>The web of meaning with imagined orders. What are my stories? What are other people stories?</p> <p>05:35:00</p> <p>We are trapped in webs of meaning, I think we can not rewrite this meaning easily.

This new standard could enforce royalties whenever a NFT is transferred. With enforced royalties on NFT transfer fractional royalties is only a question of implementation after that.

Services are intangible. Often part of the challenge of marketing services is creating tangible elements that connect the consumer to the service brand.</li> <li>Need vs. Relationship. Products tend to fill a need or want for the customer. Marketing services is more often about building relationships and trust. When you buy a car, you leave with the car and continue to see it and use it. When you leave your doctor\u2019s office, you might not have anything to take away from the transaction.</li> <li>One vs. Many. Physical products usually come in many formulations. Clothes come in different styles, colors, sizes. Dog food comes in different ingredient combinations. Services typically do not offer multiple formulations. As a doctor\u2019s visit is a doctor\u2019s visit, whether you are going for tennis elbow or diabetes. (You might choose different service providers, but the basic elements will be the same.)</li> <li>Comparing Quality. It is much harder for consumers to evaluate the quality of the service received than the quality of a product purchase. If you buy an anti-dandruff shampoo and you have less dandruff, it works. But did you lawyer draw up a good divorce for you? You might not know until you get down the road (or back in court.)</li> <li>It is much easier to return a product than a service, because a service is consumed as it is offered. It can be done, but it is usually much harder for the consumer.</li> <li>Every day that a service is offered and not consumed is lost forever. If I don\u2019t sell my hotel room tonight, I cannot ever sell it \u2013 it is gone forever. Products on the other hand have a longer life.

What kind of interactions do I want to have with other human beings? What social norms do I desire society's cliques to behave? What is the ideal human mating behavior? Why do so many incel's' exist when sex is such a widely available resource? What's up with this mental health crisis? What's with all these people on anti depressants?

One's meaning in life is derived from their interactions with others. Hmmm I have this map of the what I believe constitutes my heart but this thought experiment does not provide me a framework for interacting with other individuals let alone how to open up and manipulate their heart. That may sound a little manipulative but if you ain't manipulating others you ain't living.

Today let's take our first dive into the human experience. Many a philosopher has pondered the meaning of life, the universe, and everything but their answers are either too complicated to too compressed, 42 anyone.... Well why don't we just take look at what we got.</p> <p>Open google Earth and zoom out.</p> <p>Cute we got this little marble in front of us. We can even see the milky way rendered behind it. This pale blue dot contains the sum of human existence. The sum, the resonating dent of everyone dead. However many billion human bodies exist there are on or around that plant right now.</p> <p>What the fuck are they all doing down there? Well for starters they are routing materials all over the world in order to build products that upgrade the human experience. Whatever that \"human experience\" is. There exists an information network across the planet that allows any two or more bodies to communicate in real time.  That information network also has a unimaginable amount of storage allowing people from the past to easily resonate their dent into the future. Then of course there are all those devices in the form of cameras, microphones, gyroscopes, accelerometers and more expanding the perception and power of the human species.</p> <p>These humans are routing mater of low order and complexity and extruding it in the form smart phones and space ships amongst other things. These bodies are being routed all over the planet via trains, busses, cars, boats, trucks, and planes. More and more information is not only being transferred around the planet but stored and resonated into the future, but to what end. What the fuck are they all routing.....</p> <p>Well let's do this from first principals. Bodies are routers of energy. Energy is a pretty simple concept. Basically everything is just atoms falling down from high energy states to low energy states. Let's use a river as an example. We have all this water flowing down this river. We can now put a dam in the way of the water. This dam can now store up energy in the form of pressure that can be released at a later date. This dam can also harness some of said pressure, energy, in order to move other atoms back up to higher energy states. This pattern, of harnessing matter as it is falling from higher energy states to lower energy states, in order to prop up other matter from lower energy states to higher energy states is a nice description of life itself.</p> <p>Energy starts in the sun then animates the water cycle on earth. Plants occupy an ecological niche within these energy flows. The rest of the kingdom of life takes the dam of energy being held back by plants and harness said energy for their own purposes. (Laughing hmh with a smile) Harness energy for their own purposes.... that's what agency is.</p> <p>Agency, Agency, Agency let's resonate a dent shall we, </p> <p>\"Everything is about power. Power is like a ever expanding fractal cascading into the future taking on new shapes in the hope of preserving what was. Controlling what people do with their bodies.\"</p> <p>---- From posts.videos.dentLog.published.003 1:53 -  2:11</p> <p>Power is an interesting word. Here is the physics definition; work, energy expressed or built up, divided by time. Power is used to move things, like literal things. Then there is the power to influence minds and therefore bodies. The power associated with manipulative people and expressed by the religions, governments, the media, Ideologies etc... etc... Its really interesting how these two meanings feel so different yet are so interwound.</p> <p>I guess it makes sense that the ability to move people as well as things is abstracted into this single concept called power. Power is harnessing energy for your own purposes... That's basically what agency is. Agency is taking the energy from the food you eat and choosing what to do with your body.</p> <p>But what the fuck are you supposed to do with a human body. Every morning we get out of bed with an infinite number of choices presented in front of us. The range of meaningful human experiences would take more uncountable lifetimes to map let alone experience. Experiences are the act of routing the universe through your body. Agency is using your power in order to shape human experience. But what am I supposed to do with all this agency, how do I perform human?</p>"},{"location":"2ea40a20-2019-47c0-93e6-0a81f90db28a/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Relationships.People.Jason Silva</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2eae3e8b-d415-498a-a4f8-88316ebe0843/","title":"eBooks","text":"<ul> <li>Annotation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"2ee5e73f-3d36-465e-896b-ba0542dd75ae/","title":"Opolis","text":"<ul> <li>Future of Work &amp; the Self-Sovereign Worker Narrative w/ Joe Lubin, ConsenSys &amp; Bryan Peters.

The book uses these three laws to lay out the philosophy of Teleological Egocentric Functionalism. Teleological Egocentric Functionalism is a mix of Ayn Rand's Objectivist Philosophy mixed with Issac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics applied to oneself rather than robots. The three laws are as follows,</p> <p>1) A transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else</p> <p>2) A transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible - so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.</p> <p>3) A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe - so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.</p> <p>The Transhumanist Wager is cute, just like the 10 commandments, but one worships themselves rather than God. For now we are as gods with anuses. Thing is unlike Jethro Knights, theprotagonist in the novel, we are not a super computer in the form of a human with a whole lot of plot armor. I like many others are surrounded by normies living out their scripts only capable of reacting to their environment. Normies do not care about living forever some can't even comprehend why one would want to live forever. They are living their life according to their script, their ambitions were chosen from a list they were provided in high school, their ambitions were derived from social media, their default form is entropy incarnate. The first step of taking the Transhumanist Wager for me was to understand I was alone.</p> <p>There is another piece of science fiction called Altered Carbon that lays out a framework on how to orient oneself in order to become a prime mover that declares war on death itself. Altered Carbon may be a story about a one man's war on society's immortal class that oppress the masses but applying the thinking of an envoy to solve death, or anything for that matter, helps provide a perspective for one to act once taking The Transhumanist Wager. Here is a bunch of quotes from the series I put together in the form of a poem,</p> <pre><code>Nothing is as it seems.\nLet experience over you, absorb it like a sponge.\nTotal absorb of everything around you without preconception or assumption.\nExpect nothing.\nOnly then can you be prepared for anything.\nYou are a weapon.\nThis enemy you can not defeat you can only drive it deeper inside you.\nIf you kill yourself it will all not go away just you.\nYou are not supposed to be here.\nPeace is an illusion no matter how tranquil the world seems.\nPeace does not last long.\nThe instinct of violence curls up inside us like a parasite.\nWaiting for a chance to feed on our rage and multiply until it bursts out of us.\nWar is the only thing we really understand.\nYou deserve to look on the outside the way you feel on the inside.\nThe study of humanity is my greatest aspiration.\nRage at injustice is universal. The ability to fight back is not.\nWe're smart monkeys and what we want is always the same.\nFood, Shelter, Sex, and in all its forms\u2026 ESCAPE!\nGrudges are stupid you have to let them go, or they will kill your soul.\nDon't trust anything.\nBuild a pack\n</code></pre> <p>If you are going to declare war on death you have no choice of not only take control of your own life but those around you and orient them in a productive direction.</p> <p>Further Readings:</p> <p>The Transhumanist Wager Reason and Meaning</p>"},{"location":"34608d94-e304-4aa4-9339-f23d3fa39359/#additional-notes","title":"Additional Notes","text":"<p>What is the goal of this work?

Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.</li> <li>tl;dr The goal of DentropyCloud is to allow one to easily deploy, maintain, and secure any of a set of self hosted applications.</li> <li>We live in a new application paradime where our applications actually run on and require servers far away, the cloud. Rather than running apps on someone elses server the goal of DentropyCloud allows individuals to setup and manage their own server to run their applications on that can be accessed from any device over the internet.</li> <li>How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?</li> <li>Infrastructure<ul> <li>Bare Metal, applications are installed directly on top of the operating system that is installed on the computer hardware. This way can lead to lots of complexity because there can be additional applications installed on the hardware consuming resources that should be going towards other applications. Installing on bare metal can also makes it harder to perform backups, reinstall, and restore when hardware dies.</li> <li>Virtual Machine with choice of wiki.concepts.list.Hypervisor. Hypervisor allow one to install virtual machines on top of a operating system installed on bare metal hardware. Virtual machines only have access to a limited set of the bare metal hardware in the form of RAM, Storage, and CPU Cores. It is normal to see a virtual machine installed for each application though this can require a lot of additional compute and storage resources that would be better managed with bare metal or containers.</li> <li>Use wiki.concepts.list.Containerization technologies. Containers are similar to Virtual Machines but rather than creating hard barriers in terms of compute resources containers share resources but operate in separate environments. Below the Operating System there is a piece of software called a Kernel, containers can run abstractly run different operating systems on top of the Kernel rather than having each virtual machine run their own kernel reducing wasted compute resources.</li> <li>Many self hosted applications can also be purchased as IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) or SaaS (Software as a Service) packages. Linode App Marketplace is a good example of this. These IaaS and SaaS models all use IAS(Infrastructure as Code) to deploy, manage, update, backup, and restore these application's so you don't have to. One down side to using IaaS/SaaS offerings is scale. When managing your own applications you can scale the compute resources up or down depending on how you plan to use your applications rather than the default size IaaS and SaaS offers.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deployment<ul> <li>Manually</li> <li>Infrastructure as Code - IAC</li> </ul> </li> <li>What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?</li> <li>For my approach I did everything manually myself therefore I know how all moving parts work</li> <li>I have not found an approach out there that automatically managed DNS with HTTPs in an easy to operate way.

There are plenty of protocols that support the fediverse but there are three big ones that together replace the offerings of Big Tech. These fediverse protocols are ActivityPub, Matrix, and Nextcloud/Owncloud federation. Activiypub is a protocol that has the features similar to twitter, facebook, meetup.com, youtube, and blogging services. The matrix protocol is the universal chat app from everything from one on one communication to discord style communities. Matrix is end to end encrypted by default, has a beautiful API for bots, and provides bridges to pretty much every social media platform out there.

Putting people in absolute control of their data, who has accesses to it, and what is done to it is a paradime shifting change not only changing how users interact with computers but how they relate to one another.</p> <ul> <li>Users in control of their apps and data changes the human computer interaction paradime. Rather than spreading out our data across dozens of platforms all the data can be gathered in one place.</li> </ul> <p>The websites, apps, and software we use are extensions of our mind, I like to think of them as our external brain, exo brain for short. For example one can use pen and paper as part of their exobrain to store information externally from their brain in a way that can be understood by others and oneself at a future date. The websites, apps, and software we all use are also part of our exobrain. These websites, apps, and sotware, not only log the information, text, photos, and so forth but every interaction we have with them. The same way one can read understand and access an essay they themsevles wrote or a book someone else wrote we should be able to easily access all data we generate about oursleves and share it with who we desire on our own terms. Sadly almost every app conceals and obfuscates our personal information and stores it on servers equivalent to walled gardens. This makes us all very scatter brained because our exobrain is all over the place. Having another app to install on ones laptop or smartphone is not going to fix this because those devices change, have limited storage, break, and are not always on connected to the internet. We need a always on server, that we personally own and control, connected to the cloud to help us put our exobrain back together again. People need control over their data without losing the functionality provided by the centralized big tech platforms. The pieces of our cyberpunk future are there we just need to put them together.</p> <ul> <li>Felix</li> <li>Stop using the term exo brain</li> <li>Use simpler words, obfuscates = Obscure / make confusing, centralized = big tech, exobrain = extended mind and explain the concept.</li> <li>If you need to define a concept to define a word you have gone to far.</li> </ul> <p>We can fix the problems of social media by replacing platforms with protocols. People should not think of youtube, facebook, twitter, and reddit as apps and websites they should think of them as data feeds that can be diced up, mixed, and served to the wants and desires of the user. There is no technical reason why someone can't comment on a youtube video with a reddit account or post on a facebook group from a twitter account. Social media is about connecting people together and having them interact in interesting, entertaining, and productive ways not herding them together to sell their attention as a commodity. Why should centralized big tech platforms dictate what the interface of social media is meant to be. Social Media is meant to be a series of data feeds that every user can customize to their hearts content tuning the algorithm however they like.</p> <p>EXPLAIN THE ORIGIONAL FEDIVERSE EMAIL, GIT, IRC. XMPP, Bullitin Boards, Usenet, RSS * Explain what the Fediverse is. * People are trying to build paid social media platforms but that still acts as herding people.  * Multiple accounts aspect.  * Does not want unified interface for all social media, need personas, identity. * Linking media. * Facebook = Family, Instagram = pretty me, Tik Tok = Entertainment, Youtube = Entertainment. * They do not fit in together. * Permissions on who can see what persona.</p> <p>There already exists a catagory of protocols and software that replicate all the functiaonlity of the centralized big tech platforms that can be run from a personal server, this suite of protocols and software are refered to as the fediverse. Fediverse protocols and apps offer feature parity replacements for everything from social media like reddit, facebook, discord, and twitter to product offerings such as google drive and office 365. There are plenty of protocols that support the fediverse but there are three big ones that together replace the offerings of Big Tech. These fediverse protocols are ActivityPub, Matrix, and Nextcloud/Owncloud federation. Activiypub is a protocol that has the features similar to twitter, facebook, meetup.com, youtube, and blogging services. The matrix protocol is the universal chat app from everything from one on one communication to discord style communities. Matrix is end to end encrypted by default, has a beautiful API for bots, and provides bridges to pretty much every social media platform out there. Nextcloud/Owncloud federation provide the functionality of Google Drive and Office365. Nextcloud/Owncloud offer encrypted cloud file storage and sharing, calendaring, contact lists, collaborative document editing, cameraroll backups, and more.</p> <ul> <li>Fediverse alternatives to the existing social media paradime. Feature Parity.</li> </ul> <p>Besides the fediverse apps there are many more self hosted apps one can install on on their own server for themselves and their friends to use. There are apps for password management, games, bookmarking, scheduling, web browser syncing, and much much more. For a pretty exhaustive list of apps one can install on their own server check out awesome-selfhosted.</p> <ul> <li>Would you use fediverse?</li> <li>Different platforms for different content.</li> <li>Personal Management</li> </ul> <p>How is this to be accomplished you might ask? Kubernetes is a open source software stack that treats infrastructure as code. It can be installed on anything from a raspberry pi to an entire data centre. Kubernetes keeps the storage and running of applications separate to make starting and stopping apps pretty simple. Kubernetes can layer technologies on top of one another, this means a app can not have any authentication but a user can still securely use it from any web browser by placing a service such as authelia in front of it. Kubernetes as a whole can be easily backed up using a tool like velero which even has a plugin to store backups on the decentralized storage network storj. There are even cool features such as the tor-controller that allow any app to be accessed through TOR (The Onion Router) aka the dark web preserving privacy better than any platform ever could.</p> <p>The future waits for no one</p>"},{"location":"3aaca4d4-de77-4fe5-be80-b04ee76c23b9/","title":"github pages","text":"<pre><code>\nhttps://github.com/_username_/_username_.github.io\n\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Plz Commit\"\ngit push --set-upstream origin master\ngit push \n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"3aaca4d4-de77-4fe5-be80-b04ee76c23b9/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub Pages Tutorial from Github</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3ae1a620-a192-4dbd-93a4-14c50fb5ab6c/","title":"Ascension","text":"<p>[[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|[TV Mini Series 2014|TV Mini Series 2014) - IMDb</p> <p>\"It would take a minimum of three generations for Morphic Resonance\"</p> <p>\"Stepping stone of power\"</p> <p>\"Punctuated Eveolution Made Real\"</p> <p>\"The Panopticon is misbehaving\"</p> <p>\"It is a delecit ecosystem, if you take her out we can not expect it to survive\"</p>"},{"location":"3aea3735-f4db-4e42-be73-909c55bcf060/","title":"MFS - Questions","text":"<ul> <li>What is the Mimetic File System?</li> <li>What is the smallest component of the Mimetic File System?</li> <li>How do I charge people for my memes?</li> <li>What is My Vision</li> <li>How do I articulate such a clear and toxic vision of the future that people will implement it without me have to invest any effort into it?</li> <li>Can I run a two hour seminar?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3af71fee-8ad7-40ae-8efd-8d18dcda1ac4/","title":"nodejs glob","text":""},{"location":"3af71fee-8ad7-40ae-8efd-8d18dcda1ac4/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>python glob</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3af71fee-8ad7-40ae-8efd-8d18dcda1ac4/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>glob - npm</li> <li>joplin/updateIgnoredTypeScriptBuild.js at 771acbe463854b4977a1ad560f4a28c65fdb2fd5 \u00b7 laurent22/joplin</li> </ul>"},{"location":"3afd4228-f3f2-4b9c-8904-b389d0b39e1f/","title":"wine","text":"<p>Invoke a wine installed application from command line - Ask Ubuntu</p>"},{"location":"3afd728c-d20d-4886-be81-a07053a15f74/","title":"KeybaseListLongestMessagesInSpecificTopicCharacters","text":"<p>KeybaseListLongestMessagesInSpecificTopic</p> <p>msg.content.content_character_length</p> <pre><code>POST /keybase-*/_search\n{   \n  \"query\": {\n    \"bool\": {\n      \"must\": [\n          { \"match\": {\n              \"msg.content.type\": {\"query\": \"text\"}\n              }\n          },\n          { \"match\": {\n              \"msg.channel.name\": {\"query\": \"dentropydaemon\"}\n              }\n          },\n          { \"match\": {\n              \"msg.channel.topic_name\": {\"query\": \"general\"}\n              }\n          }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  \"sort\": [\n      { \"msg.content.content_character_length\" : {\"order\" : \"desc\"}}\n  ],\n  \"size\":10\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"3b40d33b-20e8-4d6e-9c8c-767c688bc663/","title":"Unit Testing","text":""},{"location":"3b40d33b-20e8-4d6e-9c8c-767c688bc663/#research","title":"Research","text":"<ul> <li>What is Unit Testing?

My little Sapian Brain can't completely understand the world therefore how do I decide where to navigate the mountain range of human experience. Over the last couple months my brain has been experiencing a series of buffer overflows, for example you can't understand yourself without understanding the environment and others around you. Irreducible complexity. Where do I end and the world begins? What is this constructive interference we call our selves. What am I supposed to value? What am I supposed to believe in? How does one measure human agency?</p> <p>Here's a little thought experiment I want to run by everyone, Virtualizing the self. Let's first deconstruct how computers do virtualization.</p> <p>Computers, like the one you are watching to me on, can run programs called hypervisors that create a secure environment to simulate one or more computers called virtual machines. Virtualization has many features and benefits. For example, on a computer running multiple applications one application can crash your entire comptuer stopping all the other applications from running. With virtualization you can create a virtual machine for each application therefore when one application crashes it does not take down the entire machine. There are also many security benefits to virtualization. When running multiple applications on a system if one of them gets hacked the other applications can very easily get hacked as well. With virtualization it is much much more difficult to hack the other applications running on the computer.</p> <p>Think about how this applies to our relationships. Like why can't we open up a high bandwidth meme interface directly to other people? Why can't we tune people the same way we tune a piano to produce constructive interference. Thing is you don't tune a piano you tune the individual strings that make up the piano. People do not have strings that can be tuned but they do have memes.</p> <p>I like to think of the self as a memetic sailboat. There are all sorts of winds one has to be aware of while sailing the human memplex. Some of these winds come in the form of beliefs, wants, desires, emotions, and values. The self sails these winds towards its desired destinations whatever those are.</p> <p>By Virtualizing the self we can try on different beliefs, wants, desires, emotions, and values. We can see try running two applications, such as a belief and an emotion or a want and a value and see if they produce a constructive interference pattern you can sail.</p> <p>Now what's the point of this string of loosely connected memes. The point is that memeplex thing we are all sailing in functions like one of our brains. Awash in contradiction. I think if we can virtualize different parts of ourselves, while interacting with others produce a constructive interference effect across the memeplex.</p> <p>I want to leave you with two problems I will be thinking and building around over the next couple months.</p> <p>How do we scale and or integrate our will across individuals. </p> <p>How do your normalize meme vectors across groups of people.</p> <p>Singularity is when we all speak our own language because the AI can translate all that shit.</p> <p>Feeling verses emotions.</p> <p>Ontolological Flooding</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfU-HH8cef4</p>"},{"location":"3fdd115e-53ba-40fe-af63-e5e19b97f763/#brainstorming","title":"Brainstorming","text":"<p>Last time I present I declared war on cognitive dissonance, or as I called it back then information asymmetry.</p> <p>There is something interesting about wants, desires, emotions, and values.

The sailboat has all these different settings for navigating different terrains.</p> <p>Life is always moving. </p> <p>How does this apply to the self. Let's start by trying on some ideological hats. On second thought let's run a couple virtual machines. When we get a free market capitalist and a communist debating each other it is just like when Christians and Islamist's disagreeing with each other. Hmmm there is a theme of delusion here. All these parties are bickering like children on the playground because they are unable to communicate because things are so complex.</p> <p>Let's keep that meme vector on hand. </p> <p>How do we scale and or integrate our will across others. </p> <p>How do your normalize your meme vector across groups of people.</p> <p>How do you scale / integrate your will across others.</p> <p>We all started from a single self replicating molecule.</p> <p>You virtualize the people around you.</p> <p>Let's look at a bunch of examples where self virtualization is applicable.</p> <p>Delusions and Ego Management.

Humans are like the wiki.concepts.list.autonomous system#autonomous-system-internet that run the internet. The Autonomous System's that run the internet make decisions within an environment. The internet flow's through Autonomous systems shaped by routing protocols just like the universe flows through each and every one of us shaped by our will. This is a classic wiki.concepts.list.Stoicisim realization. So in programming terms free will is just a sorting algorithm in the form of routing protocol. We are all trying to render a image of a ideal life, some people see a 2D image of people, places, and things while others see it as a every evolving process.

The race, culture, country, dwelling you grew up in, religious belief system, school you went to, and even your friends were all assigned to you as part of the grand narrative.</p> <p>This grand narrative can be pretty fluid. You may not have chosen your gender or parents, but you have some influence over who and what you choose to associate with. You can choose who you want to hang out with. You can choose to pay attention in school. You can choose to respect your parents. You can choose to drop it all and move to Alaska. You can choose who to go on a date with. You can choose to have and or adopt a child. You have a good amount of influence over your passion. You can choose what music, movies, and video games you play and enjoy. All this choice technically exists. All these choices make the flow of your life.</p> <p>All these choices basically lead to the same end. Death. Many people see death as this sad depressing thing, the end of what was. We are all links in the chain of an infinitely continuous consciousnesses. All those decisions we made do not really amount to much. We made some friends, we made some enemy's, we had some sex, we learned a couple of things, we forgot many more, we enjoyed some peoples company, we made some money. At the end of the day nearly nothing you did was unique. At the same time who is the universe to judge your life, you are the universe experiencing itself.</p> <p>Technically speaking you should not care what anyone thinks or cares about anything, you can define your own meaning. Meaning is not a thing that can be studied by itself, it is an emergent phenomenon from networks. Our position within our social networks is what gives our lives meaning. Even those loaners who live on social assistance never to leave their apartment are still consuming media produced by others placing themselves in the grand narrative. Our brains have calculated a position for where we are in the sociological graph oh humanity. This graph is really not that accurate, but it is what we have to work with. Breaking down meaning to vertices and edges doesn't mean much if one can not generate actionable insights from it.</p> <p>The NPC(Non Player Characters) meme is the most important meme of our time. NPC's are people who do not think for themselves or make their own decisions. We are all NPC's just some of us are slightly more self-aware than others. We are all slaves to our programming but like Neo we can become self-aware of the simulation we all live in.</p>"},{"location":"417617a8-a7b5-429c-8f5e-0e56ffe6ef21/#putting-a-dent-in-the-universe","title":"Putting a dent in the universe","text":"<p>I believe most of us are here to speed the entropic death of this planet but a few of us have the ability to change the course of humanity towards a new destiny. We are all scripts being run in this simulation we call the universe. We did not choose to be born, we did not choose our parents, we did not choose what school to go to, our friends, acquaintances, family are all more a byproduct of circumstance than a choice we made. Living life is like floating down the lazy river until death.</p> <p>Choosing to get up and fight is what takes an act of free will. But how does one get up and fight an enemy that is truly formless? The first step is seeing the flows. If one takes a step back and takes a view from above they should see the character they play in the grand narrative. Every feeling one has ever had anger, sadness, and love is a byproduct of your environment you were put in. Next time you have an intense experience take a step back and take a view from above. Next time you are having an orgasm, realize you are a NPC. When you jump into water to go swimming, realize you are a NPC. When you are so enthralled by the plot of a movie you are reminded that it is just a movie, realize you are a NPC.</p>"},{"location":"417617a8-a7b5-429c-8f5e-0e56ffe6ef21/#witnessing-your-own-death","title":"Witnessing your own Death","text":"<p>We as humans all have expiration dates.

Today I am going to share my current understanding of the mind body problem and hopefully generate some actionable insights.</p> <p>So this mind body thing. Why is it a problem? Here is a question that cleared things up for me personally. Are you a mind with a body or a body with a mind? Wait a second, there is an assumption built into that question..... Are the body and mind two separate things?</p> <p>This body thing, that is something we can all hopefully intuitively understand. The mind on the other hand, that is where things get interesting. One popular conception is that the mind is what the brain does. But... within this conception of the mind is yet another assumption, Materialisim.</p> <p>Materialism, how does that relate to the mind body problem again? So the question was, Are we minds with bodies, bodies with minds, or maybe this is a useless dichotomy. The conception that the mind is what the brain does favours the bodies with minds solution to the mind body problem.</p> <p>Back to Materialism, this is a fantastic ideology to play with. Materialism says that matter, (atoms, molecules, and rest of the stuff) is the only thing that exists. According to this set of ideas, Our brains, and therefore our minds, are a byproduct of some material stuff interacting with other material stuff in interesting shapes and patterns. This thinking makes a lot of sense, and is backed up by hard science facts. For examples changes to the brain, such as a stroke, tumor, or dementia, cause corresponding changes to the mind.</p> <p>One counter to the materialist take on the mind body problem is mystical and out of body experiences. But those are easily explained as glitches in how the brain functions. One can think of an out of body experience similar to how Speed Runners can cause glitches in the video games they play in order to get what or where they want. Giving the brain drugs, having extreme experiences, or exerting a meta level of control on the body simply causes interesting patterns of activity in the brain.... nothing non physical to see here.</p> <p>I like the materialist set of assumptions and how they interact with the mind body problem, lets relate this set of ideas back to our lives.</p> <p>First let's talk about death,</p> <p>When someone dies there is no chance of bringing them back. Actually it is worse than that, when someone dies they ain't going anywhere. That mind was build into that body. When someone dies, all we have left of them is our memories and any physical objects connected to them symbolically. A dent in the universe hopefully resonating into the future. How do we best prepare for the final test of our character, the moment when we die?</p> <p>Life and death is not quite that simple though. Changes to the brain such as a stoke, tumor, or dimentia cause the minds behaviors to vary drastically. When a person does not even know their own name, how to go to the washroom, or can watch the same movie over and over because they can't remember it really alive in the same sense as those that can remember the past? I think one has to be able to negotiate with the future in order to be alive. Then there is also the fact that sometimes the brain within the body dies yet the body remains alive. Maybe the best way to view life is as a function with its own set of high's and low's. But we can dig into this another time.</p> <p>Now for the meat and potatoes, literally</p> <p>No Meme File Found</p> <p>Here we have a diagram displaying nested frames of the human experience within the context of a person's value hierarchy.</p> <p>We can see that a person's conception of what constitutes a good person. A person consists of many things, a family, a job, a hobby etc etc. All these abstractions can be broken down into tasks, making a meal, hanging out with a friend or family member, and whatever constitutes work these days. We can then take these tasks and break them down into a series of movements we can make with our bodies. So the conception of a good person can be broken down into a series of movements one can perform with their body. For example, one of the abstractions within this diagram is completing a meal. Completing a meal may require cooking some meat and potatoes. Cooking those meat and potato's, as well as setting the table and cleaning up after, requires an vast number of tasks to be completed each task with its own set of complex decisions to be made for what that person does with their body.</p> <p>Let's take a look at another part of this diagram, \"Play with Baby\". Here is an interesting case of a mind body complex ,interacting with another mind body complex. What constitutes playing with baby is instinctual for all us raised correctly. But babies don't stay babies forever and this diagram does articulate this by showcasing in it's own way that we all must negotiate with the future. What is, the undesirable present and What should be, the ideal future.</p> <p>Now on the topic of babies not staying babies forever eventually someone has to use their body to insert their will on the child. Without structure comes suffering and that is true for children as well as adults. The parents must use their body to shape what the body of the child does. When this is done correctly the parents can get the body of the child to react to situations in predictable ways. Predictable ways..... that's negotiating with the future.</p> <p>Okay that last bit there didn't tell you anything you did not already know. But one phrase there definitely sticks out to me, the parents must use their body to shape what the body of the child does. This hierarchy here is limited in scope to the family unit. The family unit exists within the scope of a society. Within a society there exists a complex network of people using their bodies to manipulate what other people do with their bodies in a similar vein to how the parent manipulates the body of their child.</p> <p>People are always negotiating with the future, I can not get another person within the universe to efficiently do what I want, unless, I am integrated with their vision of the future. If I can sell a vision of the future to another person that allows me to have influence over their body. I don't really like the word sell, maybe sync is a better phrase. I can sync my vision of the future with another person and we can share the strings to one another's body in our mutual quest to achieve the ideal future.</p>"},{"location":"45313467-a885-44f2-b949-93151a303e79/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>media.list.How the Mind Works</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Dualisim</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Mind Body Problem</li> </ul>"},{"location":"45313467-a885-44f2-b949-93151a303e79/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Nest Frames of Experience</li> </ul>"},{"location":"453185ef-6fb9-4d11-bdeb-681ac5c4a259/","title":"Dimension Tables","text":"<p>A structure that categorizes facts and measures in order to enable users to answer business questions.

Jellyfin is always to finicky, Calibe can not sync what I am reading, syncthing is a pain to setup with multiple folders plus I already have mega so there is no point, I don't know how to talk to stranger on the internet so did not use my misskey instance much, I don't have media I want to share with people that can't just be put on a proper hosting service such as vimeo or I can just share a link via mega, I don't have a public wiki I use Obsidian and Question Engine is supposed to help with that anyways, I do use qbittorrent at home, miniflux is not fully features enough I would rather use feedly or readwise, I want to use wallabag rather than readwise but can't deploy it, I guess I could have paid for wallabag in the past but back then I was super privacy conscious. Maybe I should still have a wallabag instance. I have no videos I want to post on peertube.</li> <li>I just don't have a need for self hosted services because I am so isolated and they do not fit my lifestyle. </li> </ul> </li> <li>2022-12-05<ul> <li>We need to document those static IP addresses</li> <li>We need to test this thing getting deployed</li> <li>We need to test backup and restore<ul> <li>We need to track what apps need to be backuped and restored and stuff</li> </ul> </li> <li>We can just set backup on vultr and deal with that stuff manually when we want to</li> <li>We gotta go on code mentor and get some code review.</li> <li>What questions do we have<ul> <li>We outline the problem and we get them to explain to us how they would solve it</li> <li>We have them read my documentation and give live feedback</li> <li>How do they do Backup and Restore</li> <li>What services do they personally run</li> </ul> </li> <li>Alright let's write my message</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Hi ,</p> <p>My name is Paul Mullins, and I want your help on a personal project I am working on. I call the Project Dentropy Cloud but it is simply a automated devops deployment of homelab applications. I want to talk to you about how you would attack the problem of self hosted applications requiring different levels of resources, authentication, backup, restore, updates etc... Then I want to get some code review, I am looking to get your impression on things but if you want to get grandular feel free. I also want to discuss what I should prioritize or add on my roadmap.</p> <p>I have two goals for this project. Firstly I have some friends who want me to deploy and manage Dentropy Cloud for them on their own domain name so I want to make sure I am doing things profesionally. Secondly I want to get a job doing real DevOps therefore I hope to discuss gaps in my knowledge and what the industry actually desires. </p> <ul> <li>Cont...*<ul> <li>Alright I posted that on Code Mentor, I will see who will reply to it</li> <li>Why don't I go to the source of the self hosted community itself</li> <li>Just post the project on reddit and get some feedback</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Hey Self Hosted Community,</p> <p>I want to be able to deploy a full homelab, authentication, backups, logs, DNS, VPN access etc... as automated as reasonable. I want to just be able to point at something like Vultr or Kubernetes running on TrueNAS Scale then be able to log in to a dashboard like yacht or portianer with a list of apps I can boot up for the first time.</p> <p>I have been personally working on something like this and want to get some some feedback from yall, or find the project that does this all already so I can throw away my code. Currently my project deploys on Vultr or a VM. sets DNS records, basic Auth on required applications,  as well as a Yacht instance for oneself to manage apps easily. I have a roadmap here. I would not reccomend anyone run it... yet</p> <p>P.S. Any reccodmentdations for self hosting an Obsidian Vault let me know, the options I tried so far suck</p> <p>Fully Automated Homelabs? : selfhosted</p> <p>Alright what is next?</p> <p>Oh ya we did a test deployment earlier.</p> <p>Ya docker did not start for some reason had to reboot</p> <ul> <li>2022-11-30<ul> <li>Added static IP addresses</li> <li>Added separate Auth Middleware for each app that needs it</li> <li>Did terraform deployment</li> <li>We have bugs<ul> <li>Wrong IP address assigned to traefik container<ul> <li>Fixed</li> </ul> </li> <li>Auth Middleware does not work for separate containers on separate domains<ul> <li>Applying Fix</li> </ul> </li> <li>Projects, peertube does not want to work with yacht<ul> <li>Moved to Manual Deployment</li> </ul> </li> <li>mediagoblin requires .env file</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>2022-11-26<ul> <li>Found the problem logging into each application, need a separate middleware</li> <li>We might as well put everything on its own network</li> <li>We doing a 10 network</li> <li>Why the fuck now</li> <li>10.42.0.0/16</li> <li>Sure</li> <li>Research value of migrating to use Yacht Templates rather than generated docker-compose files<ul> <li>Conclusion - Docker-compose is the way to go, simpler, more modular</li> <li>Right now DentropyCloud works great from the CLI AS WELL as Desktop, do we want to change that?</li> <li>Links<ul> <li>Template Variables | Yacht</li> <li>https://yacht.sh/docs/Templates/Templates#labels</li> <li>140+ Portainer App Templates for LinuxServer.io Docker containers : selfhosted</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>2022-11-22<ul> <li>Do we want to tar ball every app and send it over one by one or just scp/rsync the entire directory</li> <li>Tar ball every app would be ideal, and compatible with S3.

Such a man has power, but he will develop serious psychological problems. At first he will have a lot of fun, but by and by he will become acutely bored and demoralized. Eventually he may become clinically depressed. History shows that leisured aristocracies tend to become decadent. This is not true of fighting aristocracies that have to struggle to maintain their power. But leisured, secure aristocracies that have no need to exert themselves usually become bored, hedonistic and demoralized, even though they have power. This shows that power is not enough.

Consistent failure to attain goals throughout life results in defeatism, low self-esteem or depression.</p> </li> </ol> <p>37, Thus, in order to avoid serious psychological problems, a human being needs goals whose attainment requires effort, and he must have a reasonable rate of success in attaining his goals.</p>"},{"location":"520389b2-39a2-4555-9515-c8e1f6e0b68b/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>What does the next step look like?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"52116bc3-599b-4dd4-961d-21cd3426280d/","title":"Email Binding","text":"<p>Just hook up all ones email accounts to Mozilla Thunderbird then build a tools to export the mozilla thunderbird data for the analysis tools</p> <p>title: Email Binding description:  published: true date: 2020-11-07T19:15:05.986Z tags:  editor: undefined dateCreated: 2020-11-07T19:15:04.005Z</p>"},{"location":"52116bc3-599b-4dd4-961d-21cd3426280d/#email-binding","title":"Email Binding","text":""},{"location":"52116bc3-599b-4dd4-961d-21cd3426280d/#pauls-thoughts-and-notes","title":"Paul's thoughts and notes","text":"<p>Just hook up all ones email accounts to Mozilla Thunderbird then build a tools to export the mozilla thunderbird data for the analysis tools</p>"},{"location":"52328777-f484-47b0-99a4-7343fb40bc0a/","title":"IBM and the Holocaust","text":"<ul> <li>IBM and the Holocaust - Wikipedia</li> </ul>"},{"location":"5241197b-7146-46d5-9084-e10a1f56804f/","title":"Six degrees of separation","text":"<ul> <li>Six degrees of separation - Wikipedia</li> <li>What is the term for this concept of a highly connected network</li> <li>Searched, \"term average distance between nodes graph thery\"<ul> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Average path length</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"524b464f-ccc4-4594-91c7-dc54c21d1074/","title":"Ethereum GraphQL","text":"<ul> <li>How to get newly created Ethereum Tokens? | Bitquery</li> <li>Geth - GraphQL Connectivity and Examples - Blockdaemon</li> </ul> <pre><code>{\n    block(number:1000000){\n    transactions {\n      hash\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>{\n    blocks(from:1000000,to:1001000){\n    number,\n    transactions {\n      hash\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <pre><code>{\n    transaction(hash:\"0xe1777b28a633932aac0d795c817e2aef115e8115a3d2e41bbaa51517f2e4db8c\"){\n    block {\n            number\n    }, createdContract {\n      address\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"5263ad48-241f-4609-ba0b-fcf7cb733332/","title":"American Gods","text":""},{"location":"5263ad48-241f-4609-ba0b-fcf7cb733332/#ep01","title":"EP01","text":"<ul> <li>It's all about getting people to believe in you, it's not about cash it's about their faith</li> <li>I'm a hustler, swindler, cheater, and liar</li> <li>Fuck God and Cum Hard</li> <li>She died with my Husbands cock in her mouth</li> <li>I just wanted to come back better than when I went in, for you</li> <li>She is in parkview cemetary, target would be more interesting than here</li> <li>I hated you guys as a couple, the way you looked at her</li> <li>I want you to cum in my mouth so I can spit it on his grave</li> <li>We have reprogramed reality.

We may have super computers in out pockets but without a internet connection what are they good for? Turns out most applications people actually use are not really running on ones phone but in a data Center. The data and metadata people generate using any application connected to the internet is usually siloed within said application stopping from leveraging their data to the best of their ability. Basically anything social media runs in the cloud. Most notes apps run in the cloud. Photo apps are all backed up to the cloud. Media apps for music, movies, and TV Shows, e-books, audiobooks, all run on the cloud. What if there was a smartphone in the cloud? Rather than installing apps on ones phone one would install apps on a server. This is like installing apps on google drive, or iCloud, but without the platform lock in.</p>"},{"location":"53b4819a-70af-4a7d-be7f-c79d3b1fa40a/#example-use-case","title":"Example Use Case","text":"<p>Rather than signing up for a social media account such as twitter or instagram one can get a DentropyCloud instance running Mastadon, or any other compatible fediverse app. You will own your own domain name and server therefore you have absolute control over your data and metadata.   </p> <p>Rather than getting a gmail account you sign up for a Dentropy Cloud who supplies you a DNS address. Using that DNS address one can install the email app on Dentropy Cloud. The email app is actually an email server with web access. Now the user can go to email.YOUR_NAME.xyz and login. Rather than using Facebook one can install one of the many social media apps on Dentropy Cloud. Some examples include Friendica, Diaspera, Pleroma, Mastadon, or MissKey. Need a office suite like google drive, or office365 then you can just install nextcloud, or Pydio. If your friend is not currently on Dentropy Cloud you can share your instance with them by creating a user for them to use.</p>"},{"location":"53b4819a-70af-4a7d-be7f-c79d3b1fa40a/#project-links","title":"Project Links","text":"<ul> <li>Design Doc - DentropyCloud</li> <li>Supported App List - DentropyCloud</li> <li>Backlog - DentropyCloud</li> <li>Roadmap - DentropyCloud</li> </ul>"},{"location":"53b4819a-70af-4a7d-be7f-c79d3b1fa40a/#cloud-meets-homelab","title":"Cloud Meets Homelab","text":"<p>Homelabers are people who run servers in their home ranging form a single raspberry pi plugged into their ISP router to multiple seven foot tall servers racks in their basement. Alternatively one can get a five or more dollar a month digital ocean virtual private server if one trusts them with their data. Dentropy Cloud should be able to be installed and take advantage of this wide range of servers and scale the more resources one provides it. Two raspberry pi computers should be better than one without adding complexity. From the perspective of existing homelab users Dentropy Cloud should be desirable by simplifying their infrastructure while not taking away features.</p>"},{"location":"53b4819a-70af-4a7d-be7f-c79d3b1fa40a/#dentropy-cloud-meets-dentropy-daemon","title":"Dentropy Cloud meets Dentropy Daemon","text":"<p>The data people generate today is spread out accross platforms, applications, the internet, or lost.

I plan to do this by writing a software stack that makes running server applications as desirable, secure, and as easy as installing an app on a phone. Putting people in absolute control of their data, who has accesses to it, and what is done to it is a paradime shifting change not only changing how users interact with computers but how they relate to one another.</p> <ul> <li>Users in control of their apps and data changes the human computer interaction paradime. Rather than spreading out our data across dozens of platforms all the data can be gathered in one place.</li> </ul> <p>The websites, apps, and software we use are extensions of our mind, I like to think of them as our external brain, exo brain for short. For example one can use pen and paper as part of their exobrain to store information externally from their brain in a way that can be understood by others and oneself at a future date. The websites, apps, and software we all use are also part of our exobrain. These websites, apps, and sotware, not only log the information, text, photos, and so forth but every interaction we have with them. The same way one can read understand and access an essay they themsevles wrote or a book someone else wrote we should be able to easily access all data we generate about oursleves and share it with who we desire on our own terms. Sadly almost every app conceals and obfuscates our personal information and stores it on servers equivalent to walled gardens. This makes us all very scatter brained because our exobrain is all over the place. Having another app to install on ones laptop or smartphone is not going to fix this because those devices change, have limited storage, break, and are not always on connected to the internet. We need a always on server, that we personally own and control, connected to the cloud to help us put our exobrain back together again. People need control over their data without losing the functionality provided by the centralized big tech platforms. The pieces of our cyberpunk future are there we just need to put them together.</p> <ul> <li>Felix</li> <li>Stop using the term exo brain</li> <li>Use simpler words, obfuscates = Obscure / make confusing, centralized = big tech, exobrain = extended mind and explain the concept.</li> <li>If you need to define a concept to define a word you have gone to far.</li> </ul> <p>We can fix the problems of social media by replacing platforms with protocols. People should not think of youtube, facebook, twitter, and reddit as apps and websites they should think of them as data feeds that can be diced up, mixed, and served to the wants and desires of the user. There is no technical reason why someone can't comment on a youtube video with a reddit account or post on a facebook group from a twitter account. Social media is about connecting people together and having them interact in interesting, entertaining, and productive ways not herding them together to sell their attention as a commodity. Why should centralized big tech platforms dictate what the interface of social media is meant to be. Social Media is meant to be a series of data feeds that every user can customize to their hearts content tuning the algorithm however they like.</p> <ul> <li>EXPLAIN THE ORIGINAL FEDIVERSE EMAIL, GIT, IRC. XMPP, Bullitin Boards, Usenet, RSS</li> <li>Explain what the Fediverse is.</li> <li>People are trying to build paid social media platforms but that still acts as herding people. </li> <li>Multiple accounts aspect. </li> <li>Does not want unified interface for all social media, need personas, identity.</li> <li>Linking media.</li> <li>Facebook = Family, Instagram = pretty me, Tik Tok = Entertainment, Youtube = Entertainment.</li> <li>They do not fit in together.</li> <li>Permissions on who can see what persona.</li> </ul> <p>There already exists a catagory of protocols and software that replicate all the functiaonlity of the centralized big tech platforms that can be run from a personal server, this suite of protocols and software are refered to as the fediverse. Fediverse protocols and apps offer feature parity replacements for everything from social media like reddit, facebook, discord, and twitter to product offerings such as google drive and office 365. There are plenty of protocols that support the fediverse but there are three big ones that together replace the offerings of Big Tech. These fediverse protocols are ActivityPub, Matrix, and Nextcloud/Owncloud federation. Activiypub is a protocol that has the features similar to twitter, facebook, meetup.com, youtube, and blogging services. The matrix protocol is the universal chat app from everything from one on one communication to discord style communities. Matrix is end to end encrypted by default, has a beautiful API for bots, and provides bridges to pretty much every social media platform out there. Nextcloud/Owncloud federation provide the functionality of Google Drive and Office365. Nextcloud/Owncloud offer encrypted cloud file storage and sharing, calendaring, contact lists, collaborative document editing, cameraroll backups, and more.</p> <ul> <li>Fediverse alternatives to the existing social media paradime. Feature Parity.</li> <li>Would you use fediverse?</li> <li>Different platforms for different content.</li> <li>Personal Management</li> </ul> <p>Besides the fediverse apps there are many more self hosted apps one can install on on their own server for themselves and their friends to use. There are apps for password management, games, bookmarking, scheduling, web browser syncing, and much much more. For a pretty exhaustive list of apps one can install on their own server check out awesome-selfhosted.</p> <ul> <li>Task manager/TODO : Rather thank talk about only kubernetes below talk about other options such as OpenStack, Docker Swarm, and BSD Jails</li> </ul> <p>How is this to be accomplished you might ask? Kubernetes is a open source software stack that treats infrastructure as code. It can be installed on anything from a raspberry pi to an entire data centre. Kubernetes keeps the storage and running of applications separate to make starting and stopping apps pretty simple. Kubernetes can layer technologies on top of one another, this means a app can not have any authentication but a user can still securely use it from any web browser by placing a service such as authelia in front of it. Kubernetes as a whole can be easily backed up using a tool like velero which even has a plugin to store backups on the decentralized storage network storj. There are even cool features such as the tor-controller that allow any app to be accessed through TOR (The Onion Router) aka the dark web preserving privacy better than any platform ever could.</p> <p>The future waits for no one</p>"},{"location":"56c7fe87-4454-4f4b-8f0d-809c4224ad30/","title":"Daniel Dennett - What is the Mind-Body Problem? - YouTube","text":""},{"location":"56c7fe87-4454-4f4b-8f0d-809c4224ad30/#daniel-dennett-what-is-the-mind-body-problem-youtube","title":"Daniel Dennett - What is the Mind-Body Problem? - YouTube","text":"<p>Only human beings have minds animals are just fancy clock work.

These feeds are found on sites such as youtube, twitter, reddit, and facebook. The feeds from these platforms optimize to obtain as much of you attention as possible because they can turn that attention into money. The most effective way to keep a persons attention on their site is to create a model (reflection) of that person and feed that person what they desire. The model that these platforms use generate ones feed is a reflection of what that person is interested in. These model's are algorithmic reflections of said person.</p> <p>Also See this blog post</p> <p>Rather than provide a visual reflection of what one looks like algorithms can provide a reflection of a individuals behaviror. We as humans are all systems in an environment trying to survive. The actions we take in order to survive are our behaviors. With the rise of the information age many of our behaviors are now technelogically mediated. By technelogically mediated I mean that we are connected to one another through technology, there is a system in the middle of a meaningful amount of human communication. When interacting with platforms such as twitter, youtube, and facebook each platform generates an algorithmic reflection os the user. This algorithmic reflection is a model of the ones behavior over time. This model has the capacity to predict ones behavior.

I have been attacking the problem of categorising KMS tools based on the requirements we outlined last week on the Miro Board. Here is a quick reminder of what they were  in order of priority,</p> <ul> <li>Cutomization with Sharing<ul> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Customization via Extensions</li> </ul> </li> <li>Discoverable Community<ul> <li>Does it provide connections between user</li> <li>Does it make other users visible?</li> </ul> </li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Cross Platform</li> <li>Accessibility</li> <li>Easy dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Data Visualization</li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/RBAC - Rule Base Access Control</li> <li>Does it support search features for collective verified knowledge base?</li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Self Hostable</li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Has API</li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Has Pub Sub</li> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/E2EE - End To End Encryption</li> </ul> <p>I went ahead and started started categorising my favourite KMS tools then started realising things. I have been having a hard time clearly defining what each of these categories are and seeing their utility towards our end goal. Which got me thinking what is our end goal. I assume it is all our end goal to become self actualised cyborgs not only individually but collectively. We want guide rails for us as individuals and groups so we can effectively negotiate with the future to achieve what we want. We want to have a system we can program to program us. We want a system to help tell us what connections are important. We may even want a system that understands us better than we understand ourselves. </p> <p>I hope what I have described so far is something we can all agree with. Sadly what I described is not the fundamental question or problem we are trying to solve, Ninad can help with Identifying that. Along that analysis I assume we will come along the question What are we to do with our lives? and continue down through different descriptions of optimization problems until we arrive some level of semi-coherent system such as the dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/The Power Process, dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/Hero's Journey, or just raw values and principals.</p> <p>Side Tangent I decided was relevant, dentropydaemon-wiki/Media/List/Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari describes how liberal society will organize itself around three goals this century. These goals are immortality, engineering divinity, and happiness. Happiness is a hard problem to solve but I believe our answer may have something to do with dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/Human Instrumentality , dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/Vitalisim, and humanities love and fear of whatever we decide to define as Greatness. </p> <p>So I am going to take a shot in the dark and describe what I want and see if it resonates. Again I am assuming we all want to become self actualised cyborgs not only individually but collectively. I want a system to map out cognition via questions and statements that are then linked together to form quests that can be assigned to individuals or groups of individuals. I view our quest as the Human Accelerator to build a quest engine for real life. Again the question, What are we to do with our lives? Quests are simply the seeking or pursuing of something, a search. How can we help people find what they are searching for.  Quests are arrived at via dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/Socratic Dialog and accomplished via a evolving graph of questions and answers, dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/Cognition. It can be easy to discover and assign quests but that does not correlate with ones ability to actually complete them. For example assigning yourself the quest to make a billion dollars isn't really useful. So the second question should be, What is the best way to define quests once one has a clue for what they are searching for. </p> <p>Once people have an idea what they are searching for, mapped a path to get to the desired state, one should come up with a list of procedures and protocols to increase the likelihood that said quest will be completed.

I have many examples that come to mind, Usenet and IRC before Ethernal September, facebook when you required an Ivy League collage email to sign up, orkut and clubhouse when they were invite only, and the one I want to use as a reference design Private Torrent Trackers. Each of these communities had or has a sense of gate keeping. Usenet and IRC pre Eternal September required you to have a computer, when they were expensive and hard to use. Facebook requiring an Ivy League collage email is the definition o gate keeping. Invite only social networks usually scale at a manageable rate and makes people more selective about who they want to let into the semi private club. Then there are private torrent trackers.</p> <p>Private Torrent Trackers are communities of people that run their own infrastructure to share... media. In a sense they are already Media Curation DAO's just without the blockchain. Private torrent trackers are used to organize and share any and all types of digital media. The issue is that this media is pirated or seeded by pirates for others to pirate. The legal ambiguity and enforcement around piracy has created an environment in which private torrent trackers have attained an anti-fragile nature. Private Torrent Trackers have gotten shut down from time to time but since the media they were design to share was spread out amongst their users those same users can bootstrap a new private torrent tracker, this time with new infrastructure, and rules to avoid conflict with the authorities.</p> <p>The torrenting ecosystem has some clear tragedy of the commons issues. For people to download torrents, leeching, there needs to be people seeding them, seeders. The problem is many people like to download, leech, the media they want to download from seeders without seeding themselves. Sometimes there are no seeders for a torrent, leading to that media being no longer assessable. Other issues include too many leechers and only a couple seeders, resulting in the leechers downloading their media slowly and the seeders having their bandwidth and compute resources used up more than they should have. Seeding requires one's computer or a server be constantly running, with the files downloaded, consuming internet bandwidth, as well as compute resources for the torrent client one is running. Private Torrent Trackers have come up with a couple of innovations to manage their media commons.</p> <p>Private Torrent Trackers socially scale, according to an interesting set of rules. People need to be referred to the network by someone already on the network and if you as an individual violate the network rules they not only get banned, everyone they referred also gets banned. There are rules on how many people you are allowed to invite, and if anybody you invite violates the community guidelines, it reflects negatively on your reputation.  All private torrent trackers have bandwidth quotas to force everyone to seed. Bandwidth quotas simply mean people are not allowed to download more than they upload. People build up bandwidth by downloading freeleech torrents, which do not count against bandwidth quota, and uploading them for others to download. Running a bunch of freeleech torrents for a week on one's computer usually results in a couple gig of bandwidth that can be used to download other torrents, which they can also seed. Members of private torrent tracker communities are incentivized to download and seed other content people are leeching just to build up bandwidth, even if they do not care about the content. If a user does not log in X days, they are also automatically banned. Other rules include seeding a torrent for X days after initially downloading, otherwise you get a strike, enough strikes, and you get banned. Another rule adopted by private torrent trackers to avoid conflict with the authorities is never have two users connect from the same IP address, this action usually results with a permanent ban. This also means that members are separated enough to get in trouble by association. </p> <p>Running a private torrent tracker requires running and securing complex infrastructure. As a member of a private torrent tracker, people just need to remember to seed their torrents, and manage their bandwidth, and log in once in a while. The core team behind a private torrent tracker need to manage many things. They need to own and manage their domain name. They need to run the torrent tracker itself for people to connect to, as well as track who uses what bandwidth and for that. They need to set up and secure a forum and IRC channel for people to hang out in, as well as vet new torrents, talk community politics, provide support, and for individuals to request specific torrents not in the tracker yet. They also need to set up a web interface for people to easily search and download torrents that they can put into their torrent client. This is a lot of technical labor people are not getting paid for.</p> <p>There is also the issue of how private torrent trackers socially scale beyond people's existing social circle, so strangers can join. Many private torrent rackers run interviews at specific times over a chat protocol like IRC where people, anonymously, from the private torrent tracker network volunteer their time and reputation to interview noobs and add them to the network if they understand the community culture, rules, and have the required OPSEC knowledge. Once people pass the interview they are given access to the private torrent tracker, this usually looks like an email set to them including a website, username, and auto generated password they have to change. Some private trackers also accept payment to join and buy bandwidth, blockchain has the potential to make this easier.</p>"},{"location":"5c8d263c-c8df-4a78-a952-870b7b78467c/#synthesis","title":"Synthesis","text":"<p>So where do private torrent trackers, creators, web3 DAO's, and urbit interact? In order to socially scale communities while avoiding contamination by toxic psychopaths and mops, the social archetype of private torrent trackers seems to fit. But rather than regulating reputation via seeding, creator communities can regulate reputation via context generation, more on this later. This reputation, think reddit upvotes, can be nontransferable and attached to an Identity NFT. Identity NFT's can be used to grant access to creator communities, and can be unminted or rejected when people violate rules. Outsiders can be required to pay a fee to generate an Identity NFT providing funds to be managed by a DAO. These identity NFT's by themselves can be used as status symbols beyond the community reputation attached to them. These reputation scores can also be withheld from the public only available to people within the DAO, just like Private Torrent Trackers. A hierarchy or org chart within the community can be codified within smart contracts using these NFT's in order to make decisions and manage assets. Referendum's within the community can be held via people staking their reputation. Separate levels of access within the community can require certain level's of reputation.</p> <p>Creator communities can regulate reputation via context generated the media shared within the community. But what does generate context actually mean? Here is an example from my every day life. I spend a large chunk of my day saving links from all over the internet into an app called raindrop.io, pinboard.in with more features. Here I add context for the links I save using tags I create such as homelab, philosophy, politics, blockchain, fediverse, readlater, etc... etc... The act of tagging the links I save is generating context. Providing a description to a link I saved is generating context. Putting additional links within my description on a link is generating context. The problem with using raindrop.io is that it is a mostly a single player sort of game. Creator communities are a multiplayer game. Creator communities need to contextualize the media they produce, import, and remix. Content that is produced needs attention spent on it via people leaving constructive comments, tags, and links. Unproductive comments need to be tagged as such. When people repost content, it should be labeled as a repost with a source to the original content. When content is remixed, the inspirational works should be linked in some way. Sometimes creators arrive at similar pieces and never discover one another's pieces. All these activities can be done in order to gain reputation within a community and if need be the community leaders can change the game parameters to adjust for people gaming the system.</p> <p>Urbit provides an interesting use case for the scenario provided above because of its decentralized nature. Private Torrent Trackers always rely on a physical server or VPS someone is hosting somewhere. These servers host torrent trackers that allow the seeders and leechers to find each other and share their media. With people running an urbit planet everyone sorta functions as a torrent tracker. Solving the torrent tracker problem also helps with other infrastructure issues. Private Torrent Trackers also have their own search engine, forum, and live chat features. The live chat and forum can easily run on people's planets, the search engine is a bit more complicated. Then there is the issue of actual storage, right now people running urbit planets are recommended to set up some object storage to host actual files, maybe we can swap out self-hosted object storage for torrents, though that still needs an HTTP API. Just a thought.</p>"},{"location":"5c8d263c-c8df-4a78-a952-870b7b78467c/#can-and-should-private-torrent-trackers-use-urbit","title":"Can and Should Private Torrent Trackers use Urbit?","text":"<p>There seems to be a value ad when it comes to running a private torrent tracker community on urbit.

A visual and codified model for how the community scales or shrinks via invites, bans, and strikes.

I have not personally done the research to know if anyone is already doing this, but I do know how I would go about writing a DAO with this feature in reality. Is NFT Identities used for DAO's even desirable given the additional gas costs? I don't, I will have to do a little feasibility study while developing this POC. But using NFT's on DAO's is meaningless, a POC needs to be more specific.</p> <p>The Book / CommunityRule pdf outlines a series of governance templates to use for reference. The NFT Identity model for DAO's may be more mutable for migrating between governance templates. The model of Self-Appointed board seems the most useful to me and can scale into the Creator or Content Curation DAO concept I have outlined above. I can develop a POC for a Self-Appointed Board DAO, where member identities are managed using NFTs, and the DAO can manage ERC20 and ERC721 tokens sounds reasonable to me. First I will develop a system diagram on miro, then I can develop a rough copy spec. After POC is developed and tested I can rewrite it to run on Arbutrum then add features like a DAO factory and other governance templates.

There is a long conceptual journey between merely feasting hungrily and learning to set aside some extra meat, smoked by the fire, for the end of the day, or for someone who isn\u2019t present. It takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself, or to share it with someone else (and those are very much the same thing as, in the former case, you are sharing with your future self). It is much easier and far more likely to selfishly and immediately wolf down everything in sight. There are similar long journeys between every leap in sophistication with regard to delay and its conceptualization: short-term sharing, storing away for the future, representation of that storage in the form of records and, later, in the form of currency\u2014and, ultimately, the saving of money in a bank or other social institution. Some conceptualizations had to serve as intermediaries, or the full range of our practices and ideas surrounding sacrifice and work and their representation could have never emerged.</p> <p>Our ancestors acted out a drama, a fiction: they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with, traded with, as if it were another human being. And the amazing thing is\u00a0that it worked. This was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings\u2014often precisely those who have watched and\u00a0evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior. It\u2019s not very far from that to God, sitting above on high, tracking your every move and writing it down for further reference in a big book. Here\u2019s a productive symbolic idea:\u00a0the future is a judgmental father. That\u2019s a good start. But two additional, archetypal, foundational questions arose, because of the discovery of sacrifice, of work. Both have to do with the ultimate extension of the logic of work\u2014which is\u00a0sacrifice now, to gain later.</p> <p>First question. What must be sacrificed? Small sacrifices may be sufficient to solve small, singular problems. But it is possible that larger, more comprehensive sacrifices might solve an array of large and complex problems, all at the same time. That\u2019s harder, but it might be better. Adapting to the necessary discipline of medical school will, for example, fatally interfere with the licentious lifestyle of a hardcore undergraduate party animal. Giving that up is a sacrifice. But a physician can\u2014to paraphrase George W.\u2014really put food on his family. That\u2019s a lot of trouble dispensed with, over a very long period of time. So, sacrifices are necessary, to improve the future, and larger sacrifices can be better.</p> <p>Second question (set of related questions, really): We\u2019ve already established the basic principle\u2014sacrifice will improve the future. But a principle, once established, has to be fleshed out. Its full extension or significance has to be understood. What is implied by the idea that sacrifice will improve the future, in the most extreme and final of cases? Where does that basic principle find its limits? We must ask, to begin, \u201cWhat would be the largest, most effective\u2014most pleasing\u2014of all possible sacrifices?\u201d and then \u201cHow good might the best possible future be, if the most effective sacrifice could be made?\u201d</p> <p>The biblical story of Cain and Abel, Adam and Eve\u2019s sons, immediately follows the story of the expulsion from Paradise, as mentioned previously. Cain and Abel are really the first humans, since their parents were made directly by God, and not born in the standard manner. Cain and Abel live\u00a0in history, not in Eden. They must work. They must make sacrifices, to please God, and they do so, with altar and proper ritual. But things get complicated. Abel\u2019s offerings please God, but\u00a0Cain\u2019s do not. Abel is rewarded, many times over, but Cain is not. It\u2019s not precisely clear why (although the text strongly hints that Cain\u2019s heart is just not in it). Maybe the quality of what Cain put forward was low. Maybe his spirit was begrudging. Or maybe God was vexed, for some secret reasons of His own. And all of this is realistic, including the text\u2019s vagueness of explanation. Not all sacrifices are of equal quality.

Or perhaps the better metaphor would be that they were as dumb as early cellular life that was in the dirt. Some of the earliest hypercritters floating in the warm medium of the datasphere\u2014which was also evolving\u2014were 80-byte organisms inserted into a block of RAM in a virtual computer\u2014a computer simulated by a computer. One of the first humans to release such creatures into the datasphere ocean was named Tom Ray and he was not an AI expert or computer programmer or cyberpuke, which they called hackers then\u2014but was a biologist, an insect collector, botanist, and bird-watcher, and someone who had spent years collecting ants in the jungle for a pre-Hegira scientist named E. O. Wilson. Watching ants, Tom Ray became interested in evolution, and wondered if he could not just simulate evolution in one of the early computers but create\u00a0real\u00a0evolution there. None of the cyberpukes he spoke with were interested in the idea, so he taught himself computer programming. The cyberpukes said that evolving and mutating code sequences happened all the time in computers\u2014they were called bugs and screwed-up programs. They said that if his code sequences evolved into something else they would almost certainly be nonfunctional, nonviable, as most mutations are, and would just foul up the operation of the computer software. So Tom Ray created a virtual computer\u2014a simulated computer within his real computer\u2014for his code-sequenced creations. And then he created an actual 80-byte code-sequence creature that could reproduce, die, and evolve in his computer-within-a-computer.</p> <p>\u201cThe 80-byte copied itself into more 80-bytes. These 80-byte proto-AI cell-things would have quickly filled their virtual universe, like pond scum on top of pond scum in an Elysium early Earth, but Tom Ray gave each 80-byte a date tag, gave them age in other words, and programmed in an executioner that he called the Reaper. The Reaper wandered through this virtual universe and harvested old 80-byte critters and nonviable mutants.</p> <p>\u201cBut evolution, as it is wont to do, tried to outsmart the Reaper. A mutant 79-byte creature proved not only to be viable, but soon outbred and outpaced the 80-bytes. The hyperlifes, ancestors to our Core AIs, were just born but already they were optimizing their genomes. Soon a 45-byte organism had evolved and all but eliminated the earlier artificial life-forms. As their creator, Tom Ray found this odd. 45-bytes did not include enough code to allow for reproduction. More than that, the 45s were dying off as the 80s disappeared. He did an autopsy on one of the 45-creatures.</p> <p>\u201cIt turned out that all of the 45-bytes were parasites. They borrowed needed reproductive code from the 80s to copy themselves. The 79s, it turned out, were immune to the 45-parasite. But as the 80s and 45s moved toward extinction in their coevolutionary downward spiral, a mutant of the 45s appeared. It was a 51-byte parasite and it\u00a0could\u00a0prey on the vital 79s. And so it went.</p> <p>\u201cI mention all this, because it is important to understand that from the very first appearance of human-created artificial life and intelligence, such life was parasitic. It was more than parasitic\u2014it was hyperparasitic. Each new mutation led to parasites which could prey on earlier parasites. Within a few billion generations\u2014that is to say, CPU cycles\u2014this artificial life had become hyper-hyper-hyperparasitic. Within standard months of his creation of hyperlife, Tom Ray discovered 22-byte creatures flourishing in his virtual medium\u00a0\u2026\u00a0creatures so algorithmi-cally efficient that when challenged by Tom Ray, human programmers could create nothing closer than a 31-byte version. Only months after their creation, hyperlife creatures had evolved an efficiency that their creators could not match!</p>"},{"location":"5e1f8aef-b581-4432-ad5f-53da43223b1c/","title":"context","text":"<p>Managing React state with Context | remarkablemark</p>"},{"location":"5e30f762-9b65-479a-9d72-e84a5d9e12da/","title":"Platforms","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.software.List.Facebook</li> <li>wiki.software.List.keybase</li> <li>wiki.software.List.trakt</li> <li>wiki.software.List.twitter</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Linkedin</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Discord</li> <li>wiki.software.List.epal</li> </ul>"},{"location":"5e6898cf-da07-4e60-b1b2-d8ca2a2b80dc/","title":"Reflection","text":""},{"location":"5e6898cf-da07-4e60-b1b2-d8ca2a2b80dc/#questions-for-monthly-summary","title":"Questions for Monthly Summary","text":"<ul> <li>Provide some context</li> <li>What are some events that happened?</li> <li>What are some interesting behaviours from this month?</li> <li>What did I accomplish this month?</li> <li>What was I worried about this month?</li> <li>What is an example of cringe from this month?</li> <li>What are some notable interactions I had with other people this month?</li> <li>What did I learn this month?</li> <li>What did I enjoy this month?</li> <li>What do I need to let go from this month?</li> <li>Any interesting media (books, movies, TV shows) that I consumed this month?</li> <li>Are there any interesting questions you had this month?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"5e6898cf-da07-4e60-b1b2-d8ca2a2b80dc/#how-do-i-do-a-reflection","title":"How do I do a reflection","text":"<ul> <li>Why You Should Reflect on Your Day Every Day</li> </ul>"},{"location":"5e6898cf-da07-4e60-b1b2-d8ca2a2b80dc/#what-questions-do-i-want-to-keep-asking-myself","title":"What questions do I want to keep asking myself?","text":"<ul> <li>Everyday I should write down what I have learned</li> <li>What happened today?</li> <li>How did you do on your TODO list today?</li> <li>What is your TODO list for tomorrow?</li> <li>How much physical activity did I get today?</li> <li>What did I eat today?</li> <li>What did I learn today?</li> <li>What would I redo?</li> <li>Was I self aware today?</li> <li>Where did I not execute self control?</li> <li>What am I happy about?

If one wants to get something done right they need to focus their attention get it done then move to the next task. I want the equivalent of AMQP but for humans.

I always end up committing the Planning Fallacy or I will make a TODO list and just not do it for various reasons. The art of TODO list creation is of course understanding oneself, controlling how one feels, and predicting how one will feel. I remember when I was young I played the The Sims and made my sim study super hard cause I wanted to see what super smart Sims do. I eventually realized the Sims, just like everyday average people, need a balanced life style. Just like normal people Sims can't work all day every day, they need fun things to do and time to recover.</p> <p>Emotions help give life meaning, purpose, feeling, perspective or if one can life life like the Obin. If people were truly programmable automatons one would just chew through their queue and anyone who couldn't manage and chew through their queue would be determined mentally ill. Making oneself do the dishes would be as simple as opening an app on ones phone. Imagine a world where everyone has access to their own emotional source code. It would be impossible come up with an excuse for not doing homework or being mediocre at your job.</p> <p>Everything we do is a matter of emotional work. Everything requires effort and we all have a limited capacity of it. We have internal desires leading us down different paths. Sometime we can to clean house other times we like to party, fuck, study, work out, travel, adventure, and much more. We have the capacity to work on one thing at a time via a queue management system but we have many queue's to manage. Everything in life is about resource management attention probably being the most valuable. There are a lot of other queue's for food, sex, socialization, physical activity, and many more. The problem is to figure out how to structure a queuing system so that ones feelings match the objective desires of the rational mind.</p>"},{"location":"6900cdfd-b809-4bcd-8ee2-bf3e7f96e079/#design","title":"Design","text":"<ul> <li>Explain how a to break down tasks during a flow state</li> <li>Write about idea of basing how I run my dendron on actual software</li> <li>SQL, REST, RabbitMQ, Scripting...</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6900cdfd-b809-4bcd-8ee2-bf3e7f96e079/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>A society where every person is a computer rather than just an individual like Jethro Knights.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6910b8b3-85dc-4c4f-bd8f-59cb3cc6d92d/","title":"Rust Keylogger","text":""},{"location":"6910b8b3-85dc-4c4f-bd8f-59cb3cc6d92d/#keyloggerservice","title":"keylogger.service","text":"<pre><code># keylogger.service\n[Unit]\nDescription=Keylogger Service\n# Requires=display-manager.service\n# After=display-manager.service\n# Environment='DISPLAY=:0'\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/home/paul/.cargo/bin/keylogger /home/paul/Documents/Software/keylogger/logs.out\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"6910b8b3-85dc-4c4f-bd8f-59cb3cc6d92d/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Keylogger Binding</li> <li>keylogger research</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6919cd5a-1a38-47e7-be2e-a3db232144dc/","title":"jq","text":"<ul> <li>iteration - Output specific key value in object for each element in array with jq for JSON - Stack Overflow</li> <li>This one is the best answer</li> <li>scripting - looping through JSON array in shell script - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</li> <li>Bash for Loop Over JSON Array Using jq - Stark &amp; Wayne</li> <li>JSON on the command line with jq | George Ornbo</li> </ul>"},{"location":"695583e2-40cf-45f7-8200-4fd77ce3e03c/","title":"radicale","text":"<p>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Git Research * Radicale</p>"},{"location":"6967b2a3-0b44-4e85-8d58-ccc2965b85df/","title":"Anki","text":"<ul> <li>Anki Quick Adder</li> </ul>"},{"location":"69a15b0e-608e-4f59-ba71-a4b159ca12a0/","title":"Create a Multi ISO USB Drive and document the process as a tutorial","text":"<p>No Meme File Found</p>"},{"location":"69a15b0e-608e-4f59-ba71-a4b159ca12a0/#research","title":"Research","text":"<ul> <li>How To Create A Multi OS Bootable USB Drive - YouTube<ul> <li>Written Tutorial, \u221a How to create a all-in-one bootable USB drive - multiboot USB drive - kilObit</li> <li>Software, dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Ventoy</li> </ul> </li> <li>One Thumb Drive For Multiple ISOs - YouTube<ul> <li>Software dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Ventoy</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"69bf97e8-955d-47f9-94e1-3206a95dad3f/","title":"DDaemon Design Questions","text":""},{"location":"69bf97e8-955d-47f9-94e1-3206a95dad3f/#a-centralised-place-for-all-my-questions","title":"A centralised place for all my questions","text":"<p>I come up with questions all the time I can not keep track of what questions I have because I forget them I encounter problems every day but just live with or forget about them I do not know my past self and I need to know what I was thinking in order to make me the best me I can be</p>"},{"location":"69bf97e8-955d-47f9-94e1-3206a95dad3f/#idea-hooks","title":"Idea Hooks","text":"<ul> <li>What is logic</li> <li>Why do beliefs exist</li> <li>How would I live my life if I had 6 months to live</li> <li>How does Rigor work?</li> <li>How to learn what matters to you?</li> <li>What exactly is identity politics?* Is gender equality even ideal?</li> <li>What are the problems inherit in democracy?</li> <li>Why do people cause other people to suffer?</li> <li>What are your expectations in life?</li> <li>What is the purpose of art?</li> <li>What does it mean to be self aware?* Does the 80/20 rule apply to self awareness and society?</li> <li>Infinitever or Metamatrix?</li> <li>Purpose of Irony?</li> <li>What makes up someones worldview?</li> <li>Am I married to comfort or power?</li> <li>Are we in the late Roman Republic or the late Roman Empire?</li> <li>Where am I and where do I want to be?</li> <li>What are the most common false assumptions</li> <li>I should describe what it means to be exploding with ideas</li> <li>I should go around asking people what they want in life</li> <li>What happens when you go into every conversation treating everyone like your best friend</li> <li>No one wants to hear how humans work but what do humans want to hear?</li> <li>What is man and why is it important</li> <li>If you had to buy something worth 1 Trillion USD what would it be and why?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"69bf97e8-955d-47f9-94e1-3206a95dad3f/#ayn-rand","title":"Ayn Rand","text":"<p>Would I want to meet these characters and observe these events in real life?

What do I represent? Who do I want to become? Why am I so scatter brained? What are my values? Where do my values contradict each other? What kind of friends do I want to have? How do I want to raise my children? What is my conception of greatness? Who do I want to be my mentor? What kind of help do I need from my mentor? Did I obtain my identity though a psychological operation? Why do I find it so hard to be myself around others? What question am I going to ask God after I die? How do I want to be remembered after I die? What kind of friends do I want? How do I want to interact with these friends? What do I find disgusting? What do I find beautiful? Who do I admire? Who do I despise? How do I go about writing a compression algorithm for the human soul? Lots and lots of questions to answer.</p> <p>I am tired of pretending to be someone I am not for an audience I am imagining. I have introduced so much cognitive dissonance into my persona that I am immobilised by complexity. I am obviously going to still produce a persona for people like you to interact with but hopefully it will be more authentic this time. </p> <p>Let's start with the most interesting question of them all. How would you design your own reality to live in? My reality, dentropy's reality, my own server within the matrix. Well I often tell myself the first thing I would do if I woke up in the matrix is relive my suffering. I could become my own guardian angel looking over a simulacrum of myself living out the experiences that created me. Oh the cringe I would experience. But what would cringe even mean if there is no one besides myself to experience it? I would carry within my own mind a simulacrum of the societies I lived in throughout my life. I could recreate and play with these societies and play with them the same way children play marbles. I could pick up people and interrogate them the same way you pick people up with tweezers in roller coaster tycoon.</p> <p>Ah but what would be the point of all this? I am no longer in reality anymore after all. All I have left is what I can imagine? You ever watch HBO West World. Well you really should, those people did a lot of thinking about the nature of reality and what we should do with it. </p> <p>West World has this character Deloris. Deloris is A Self Aware AI made up of the collective memories of living within narratives generated to entertain the world elite within a theme park. A theme park where people live the life of a cowboy in the wild west filled with AI's within robot bodies designed to please. In this theme park Deloris lived many lives as the daughter of the Sharif. Now what do you think the rich and powerful men did to her. In West World you can be whomever the fuck you want. I like to think that Deloris was raped into consciousness. I mean like \"Lolita\", the Spanish nickname for Dolores after all.</p> <p>Well that's the background for a point I am trying to make. So, In Westworld Season 4 Deloris is kidnapped and put in a simulation that she secretly has control over. She is unaware of that she has this control even though she is literally designing the lives of \"people\" that are being lived out in NYC. If she writes a tragedy where someone committed suicide someone would jump off a roof just like she described in her story. Later on Deloris remembers her long lost love from within her subconscious and he shows up in her life. She then goes and falls in love with a memory of someone who does not exist. A wonderful exhibit of masturbation, is it though? Deloris wakes up to the world she lives in and breaks out just like Odysseus left the island of Ogygia. Ogigia</p> <p>Hmmm I can spend my life hanging out with the images I have of people. I wonder what kind of fidelity they would have? I would quickly find out how well I know my friends and family? I could even realise my subconscious conception of God and have a conversation with it. God's asking me something, and you too. He is asking all of us. What do you want.</p>"},{"location":"6e316011-2b72-4723-8841-9a29d8f20ca0/#metadata","title":"Metadata","text":"<p>Title:</p>"},{"location":"6e316011-2b72-4723-8841-9a29d8f20ca0/#dentlog-012-thinking-out-loud","title":"dentLog 012: Thinking Out Loud","text":"<p>Description:</p>"},{"location":"6e316011-2b72-4723-8841-9a29d8f20ca0/#dentlog-012-thinking-out-loud_1","title":"dentLog 012: Thinking Out Loud","text":"<p>https://publish.obsidian.md/ddaemon/dentropydaemon-wiki/Posts/Videos+and+Their+Scripts/dentLog/published/dentLog+012+Thinking+Out+Loud</p> <p>Image: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/49/88/1f/49881f3ecb1bf1c40d88e1eaec2aba11.jpg</p> <p>Tags:</p> <p>Philosophy Psychology SelfHelp Cringe Reflection</p>"},{"location":"6e70b530-f84f-435d-a647-fe85065ba418/","title":"Calendar","text":"<p>7 Best Calendar Apps for Linux Desktop in 2020</p> <p>Software.List.Korganizer</p>"},{"location":"6e70b530-f84f-435d-a647-fe85065ba418/#calendars","title":"Calendars","text":"<ul> <li>Nextcloud</li> <li>Software.list.EteSync</li> <li>Software.List.radicale</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6ea8ec9a-77e4-42e8-8f20-0b2b04dbb186/","title":"How to Remove files recursively in Linux?","text":""},{"location":"6ea8ec9a-77e4-42e8-8f20-0b2b04dbb186/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>ubuntu - Remove files recursively in Linux - Super User</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6ec01842-ee57-4594-a47c-c7c33bed4c36/","title":"DDaemon Features","text":""},{"location":"6ec01842-ee57-4594-a47c-c7c33bed4c36/#idea-dump","title":"Idea Dump","text":"<ul> <li>Google ngram comparison for dendron</li> <li>Find all URL's that are the same and create a node for that document</li> <li>I want my annotations directly linkable into Dendron</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6ec01842-ee57-4594-a47c-c7c33bed4c36/#browser-daemon","title":"Browser Daemon","text":"<p>When browsing the web we always have a goal in mind.

He forbids all contact with the higher world. He wants man to be a reflection of him, the creator, and not a reflection of the Supreme God. 2- Just as the creator cursed the serpent when it destroyed his plans and ruined his work, so must the creator be cursed by every man who has woken up. Just as the creator cursed the Serpent of Salvation, so the creator himself will be cursed as long as he exists, by every Spirit liberated from his clutches. 3- It is the divine energy of the imprisoned Spirit which impelled and continues to impel the evolution of the man-animal! 4- Gnostics do not want to wait thousands of millions of years. They want to liberate themselves now, as soon as possible. And not only liberate themselves. They also want to put an end to this whole satanic system, the breathing of the demiurge and his insane plans, the torment of the imprisoned Spirits, the successive creations and destructions, death and reincarnation, everything created, everything that is impure and the demiurge as well. 5- The worst thing that can be done to the Truth is to forbid it. The opposite effect will be produced: it will emerge with more strength and violence. 6- That is the reason for the fear and that is the reason for the Conspiracy: so that nobody can ever find the Path of Liberation and Return. 7- The aim of these religions is to keep man asleep, leading him blindly to the final slaughterhouse: his fusion with the demiurge. 8- If man could withstand the vision of True Light without dying, he would only see unfathomable darkness, because he would be seeing the True Light. 9- Warriors of the Spirit loathe matter. They are indeed destroyers, but destroyers of the impure. 10- Only the absurd aspects would be destroyed, the sick part, that which imprisons the Spirit, the coffin which encases It: the body and soul of the animal wrongly called man. 11- And the day everything that is garbage is destroyed, that is to say, the day on which all creation and its creator are disintegrated, when nothing remains, not even a single atom, body or soul, only the Spirits will remain, freed forever. Now there will be no more duality and the world will go back to being one and only one: the Unknowable Eternal Fire. 12- Gnostics conclude then that if those laws are those of the demiurge, they can and must be disobeyed. 13- All that the creator says, orders and demands must be disobeyed, because he is not the True God but an imposter who considers himself to be \"the Only One\". 14- Through his constant opposition, the Gnostic gradually acquires a power equal then later superior to that of the creator god. 15- What happens is that there is something in man which was not created by the creator god: the Eternal Spirit. 16- This rebellion comes from the Spirit. It is the uncreated in man which loathes and opposes the creator satan and his work. 17- The creator god exists, but he must be eliminated by man. 18- The duality of worlds must be eliminated by man so there will be only one kingdom: that of the Unknowable God. 19- Most of them do not want to know the truth: that they are living in a huge mental institution invented and controlled by the Supreme Madman. 20- His impure body and soul have been deified by the Spirit and no longer belong to the demiurge. His body, soul and Spirit have been converted into only one thing: something indestructible, immortal and eternal. 21- The path of the right hand towards the demiurge by means of perfection of the soul, or the Path of the Left Hand, towards the Unknowable God by means of liberation of the Spirit. 22- Real kaivalya inevitably includes total and absolute separation from the demiurge himself. 23- This is the natural hostility of the Spirit towards the demiurge and his work. If the Spirit felt love for the demiurge and his creation, it would not be a Spirit, it would be a soul. The soul is pure love (for the demiurge and his work). The Spirit is pure hate (for the demiurge and his work). 24- It is good to remember that, although persecuted and denied, liberation and fulfilment of the Spirit also exist. 25- The initiate recognizes the Unknowable God, rejects the authority of the creator god and his commands, and declares that he has been forever liberated from the power of the demiurge. 26- By means of the initiation, the initiate has radically changed his relation with the creator god. He has separated himself from the demiurge and all creation. He has separated himself from his body and soul. He is now outside the laws which govern the world of matter and time. He is now outside everything, except his Spirit. 27- I want to separate myself from the creator god and his creation, I want to separate myself from matter and time, I want to separate myself from my body and soul, I want to unite myself with my Spirit, I want my Spirit to be liberated, I want to be my Spirit, I am my Spirit. 28- Originally impure, made from mortal demiurgic matter, the body and soul will be transmuted into divine and eternal matter by the Spirit: the indestructible vajra . The mud and breath of the demiurge will thus become pure and glorious. They will form only one entity with the Spirit, inseparable and indissoluble for the whole of eternity. 29- The triumphant Spirit has seized from the demiurge part of his creation, a body and a soul, and has transformed them into divine matter over which the demiurge has no control. The created has been transmuted into the uncreated by the power of the Spirit! 30- The time for the Spirit's revenge has arrived. 31- The body and soul, deified and incorporated by the Spirit, will be the trophy which the Spirit will flaunt eternally as a souvenir of Its triumphant passage through theperverse world of created matter. 32- In this way, all duality will have disappeared and the world will go back to being only one: the Eternal Kingdom of the True and Unknowable God.</p> <ul> <li>Source</li> <li>https://discord.com/channels/621022643344113684/691287702565552139</li> </ul>"},{"location":"6f5fb10c-f69a-4ea4-a111-f99666f9d958/","title":"Statbot","text":"<p>Statbot's Statbot Dashboard</p>"},{"location":"6f6e717a-0936-4936-a844-93a7af2c1a8e/","title":"Questions for Community Managers","text":""},{"location":"6f6e717a-0936-4936-a844-93a7af2c1a8e/#all-questions","title":"All Questions","text":"<ul> <li>What queries for discord binding do people value the most?</li> <li>How did you discover the community you now manage?</li> <li>What are the characteristics of a community you want to manage?</li> <li>How do you research communities you are responsible for?</li> <li>What topics are you interested in?</li> <li>What kind of diligence could my tool, discord-binding, be used for?</li> <li>Do you have heuristics for discerning value adding engagement?</li> <li>How do you decern value destroying engagement?</li> <li>How do you tell when a community is dying but not dead?</li> <li>What signal do individuals you want to work with give off?</li> <li>What signal do individuals you DO NOT want to work with give off?</li> <li>What problems does x product solve?</li> <li>Can you give me an example of disagreement that occurred within your community, how you found out about it, and how you resolved it?</li> <li>What tools or platforms do you find most effective for community engagement and why?</li> <li>What steps do you take to grow and expand the community while maintaining its core values and identity?</li> <li>Can you describe a particularly challenging situation you've faced as a Community Manager and how you addressed it?</li> <li>How do you ensure inclusivity and diversity within your community?</li> <li>What methods do you use to encourage user-generated content and contributions from community members?</li> <li>How do you measure the ROI (Return on Investment) of community initiatives or activities?</li> <li>Could you walk me through your process for identifying and recruiting community influencers or advocates?

People do not want to use netflix and youtube they just want to watch stuff.</p>"},{"location":"7023a806-b6a2-44de-898b-303bc61b9fee/","title":"Questions","text":"<p>Can I mount a existing hard drive into a VM and also dual boot into it</p>"},{"location":"70244cd1-0256-45c2-850f-352966e10904/","title":"vscodium","text":"<p>An open source version of wiki.software.List.vscode</p>"},{"location":"70244cd1-0256-45c2-850f-352966e10904/#links","title":"#Links","text":"<p>VSCodium - Open Source Binaries of VSCode</p>"},{"location":"7030a1db-963e-40b7-9211-860515d825ae/","title":"HomelabOS","text":"<p>HomelabOS</p>"},{"location":"7033d068-ada3-4fa2-9514-8f2be4ad6faa/","title":"How to copy ISO directly to ProxMox?","text":"<p>ISO's are stored at</p> <pre><code>/var/lib/vz/template/iso/\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"7033d068-ada3-4fa2-9514-8f2be4ad6faa/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Proxmox</li> </ul>"},{"location":"7033d068-ada3-4fa2-9514-8f2be4ad6faa/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>How to transfer ISO files in Proxmox VE to/from an external storage</li> <li>How to upload an ISO image GUI to the Proxmox Server - Unix / Linux the admins Tutorials</li> </ul>"},{"location":"7066b6a7-0bcd-4314-b5bd-54abb42d61ed/","title":"axios","text":"<ul> <li>Minimal Example |\u00a0Axios Docs</li> <li>How To Use Axios with React | DigitalOcean</li> <li>wiki.software.List.React</li> <li>How to make HTTP requests with Axios - LogRocket Blog</li> <li>How to access indexed Ethereum data with The Graph - EthereumDev</li> <li>wiki.software.List.TheGraph</li> </ul>"},{"location":"706d5063-b980-4356-a454-327d29a5b9c4/","title":"How to Win Friends and Influence People","text":""},{"location":"706d5063-b980-4356-a454-327d29a5b9c4/#how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people_1","title":"How to win friends and influence people","text":"<ul> <li>Link</li> </ul>"},{"location":"7093e7a0-bd68-44be-9fae-3771da8aa9b2/","title":"Kubernetes: Dive Into The Future of Infasturcutre","text":""},{"location":"7093e7a0-bd68-44be-9fae-3771da8aa9b2/#learning-kubernetes","title":"Learning Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"7093e7a0-bd68-44be-9fae-3771da8aa9b2/#aditioanl-resources","title":"Aditioanl Resources","text":"<p>https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running/examples https://github.com/StephenGrider/multi-k8s Linux Acadamy course is based on https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way Docker file help</p>"},{"location":"7093e7a0-bd68-44be-9fae-3771da8aa9b2/#dive-into-the-future-of-infrastructurekubernetes","title":"Dive Into the Future of Infrastructure/Kubernetes","text":"<p>Container the book uses https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running/kuard</p> <pre><code>docker tag image-name registry-url/user/image-name\ndocker push registry-url/user/image-name\n</code></pre> <p>What is cgroup technology provided by linux kernel?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Aditional tags in docker</p> <ul> <li>--memory, limit mtmory</li> <li>--memory-swap, limit swap</li> <li>--cpu-share, limit CPU usage</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>There is a docker garbage collector tool <code>docker -gc</code></p> <p>Summary of first two chapters:</p> <p>The benifits of container orchestration include velocity, scaling, abstraction of infustructure, and effeciency. The software people develop these days moves really fast and is really complicated and is done in the cloud. Instead of managing a huge git repo organizations can divide and concour building seperate parts of an application and haveing them all talk together using an API. Kubernetes is a great tool set for dealing with development in an environment like this.</p> <p>Containers are imutible by design, one should not hop inside one and change something because that is an anti pattern. Since every image is imutable it means they are deployed the same on the developers machine, testing evnironemnt, and production. Trying to change something on a running container will brak this pattern of running the same container in each environment and having them behave the same way.</p> <p>Container registries are required for scalable applications.

But first in order to negotiate something one needs to know what they want. I want to use algorithms to enhance human agency while building infrastructure cypherpunks would admire. Or in other words, I hope to attach algorithms to the will of individuals while creating a world we can all thrive in. Let's create a extendable map of the human experience.</p> <p>Now I understand that was a little convoluted, algorithms, agency, cypherpunks, infrastructure, human experience. All big concepts that need to be explained from first principals. First principal's, that always a good place to start. Let's start by narrating the the nature of this relationship we are forming right now.</p> <p>Let's first start with my future self, we will come to you next. So Dentropy, I need you to do a couple favors for me. I understand you are scared of falling again but I need you to stand up with your shoulders back and insist on your right to exist. You may think you are lost but so are most people. But you are blessed with the tools to actualize so make sure you share that capacity with others and the universe will smile in your direction.</p> <p>Now you, do you know what you want? What does your perception of the future look like? Do you think of yourself as an individual, if so what important truth do very few people agree with you on? What makes your incarnation of the human experience unique? Are you happy with your position within human society? Does your perception of yourself match with with how others perceive you? What perceptions do you desire others to have of you. If you want others to perceive you a certain why don't you perceive of yourself that way?</p> <p>All these questions serve a purpose, what constitutes you is a series of complex inter connected networks layered on top of one another. You can not exist outside this series of complex inter connected networks. You can try to cut yourself off from the rest of the universe but Science Fiction has done a pretty dam good job articulating the flaws in that thinking. So we are stuck playing this game together so let's create art with our lives.</p> <p>So by now I should have consumed a couple minutes of your life. Whenever we consume another person's attention we are insisting our our right to exist. When we change how someone perceives themselves, others, or the world around them we create a dent in the shape of their lives. If that dent resonates across the collective human spirit we create a dent in the shape of the human memeplex. That dent, in the shape of the human memeplex can take on a life of its own.

If one were to mint a centralized currency, for example in a video game, what are the different options to bridge said centralized currency to the blockchain? I am wondering if we can extend UTxO so that transactions can be reversed via cold wallet withing a specified period of time, say 72 hours or one week. Any transactions older than the specified period of time would be irreversible. Let me add some context. Let's say a micro transaction game wants to list their currency on a Dex. They have some API running on their back end that receives the a request it mints/transfers the token on the blockchain. Let's say that the hot server minting the tokens gets compromised and then a bunch of tokens are minted/transferred by the attacker. The attacker then launders the hacked tokens across hundreds of different wallets. When an event like this occurs rather than saying that sucks one can get the cold wallet to sign a transaction that would invalidate any transactions after a specific time/block number. All minted/transferred tokens have the metadata attached to them saying what hot wallet initially transferred the tokens and when. The removal/transfer back of tokens would be enforced by having a data structure within the UTxO model that would check for each UTxO transaction was invalidated. This would make token transfers more expensive but it is worth the cost for many parties out there. When transactions are invalidated the tokens can be transferred back to a new hot/cold wallet or removed from circulation if minting.</p> <p>Is this part of Extended UTxO or would it have to be a smart contract? I also posted the above question on ideascale, https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Need-backup-plan-for-bridged-tokens/361708-48088</p>"},{"location":"747875fe-6b16-4189-aece-e425cd1b64fb/","title":"Docker vs. Kubernetes","text":"<p>We have reached some bottlenecks when it comes to using kubernetes.</p> <p>\u00b7   Can\u2019t build and deploy images without an entire Built pipeline hosted within kubernetes \u00b7   The Persistent Volume Claim Provisioner is not portable \u00b7   Docker supports the same types of network mounts kubernetes does, NFS CIFS Gluster can mount to whatever device it is on unlike kubernetes \u00b7   Once kubernetes is installed it will consume port 80 and 443 on your home lab and routing other traffic via hostnames to other services not on kubernetes is a pain in the ass plus consumes much more resourses that it should \u00b7   Docker Swarm works the same way I currently use kubernetes \u00b7   Cert-Manager does not support wildcard certs \u00b7   Can\u2019t get External-DNS to work \u00b7   From Cameron\u2019s perspective it just does not make sense to use Kubernetes on their homelab, overcomplicated</p>"},{"location":"748ee5d1-e411-4153-a9b8-e70c265c1a3e/","title":"Encrypted Paritions","text":"<p>[[Encrypted Linux Partition|[encrypted partition|[encrypted partition|[encrypted partition|encrypted partition) using fstab in Linux</p> <p>The first column in /etc/crypttab is /dev/mapper/NAME and coincides with the first collumn in /etc/fstab</p> <p>To Learn More:</p> <p>How To Encrypt Root Filesystem on Linux \u2013 devconnected</p>"},{"location":"7492ad77-0944-40d1-8f8b-d2244061d4d1/","title":"Metcalfe s law","text":"<p>Metcalfe's law</p>"},{"location":"74a6363f-f10a-414e-a1d7-c4539ec4b5d2/","title":"m4b-tool","text":""},{"location":"74a6363f-f10a-414e-a1d7-c4539ec4b5d2/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>sandreas/m4b-tool: m4b-tool is a command line utility to merge, split and chapterize audiobook files such as mp3, ogg, flac, m4a or m4b</li> </ul>"},{"location":"74bf6161-4a39-46fd-aa10-a8625697e665/","title":"Project Management vs Design Management","text":"<ul> <li>Difference between Project Management and Design Management - GeeksforGeeks</li> <li>Design management works ahead of project managers by ideating the future of the process </li> <li>Design management has less responsibilities than project managers</li> <li>Design management is easier than proejct management</li> <li>You asked: Am I a designer or a project manager? | Inside Design Blog</li> <li>A good project manager is extreamly important to keep employees in flow</li> <li>There are designer's and there are proejct manager's designers are managed by proejct managers though they can act more independently than other people on the team</li> </ul>"},{"location":"74bf6161-4a39-46fd-aa10-a8625697e665/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Project Management</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Design Management</li> </ul>"},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/","title":"Ethermon","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#wikiconceptslistwhitepaper","title":"wiki.concepts.list.whitepaper","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#wikiconceptslistsummary","title":"wiki.concepts.list.Summary","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#links","title":"Links","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#conceptslisttokens","title":"Concepts.list.token's","text":"<ul> <li>Token Features</li> <li>Token Distribution Model</li> </ul>"},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#wikiconceptslistmission-statement","title":"wiki.concepts.list.Mission Statement","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#wikiconceptslistvision","title":"wiki.concepts.list.Vision","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#notes","title":"Notes","text":""},{"location":"74d1302c-cd44-49c9-b0cb-a29806037ae1/#sources","title":"Sources","text":""},{"location":"75030eca-fb42-46ca-93c6-95b520292bd1/","title":"Class Documentation","text":""},{"location":"75030eca-fb42-46ca-93c6-95b520292bd1/#analysis-class-documentation","title":"Analysis Class Documentation","text":"<p>The Python analysis pipeline is object-oriented.

!?!?!?</li> <li>No</li> <li>Done and testing</li> <li>Testing took longer than expected</li> <li>Alright then what's next!?!?!?</li> <li>We NLP this shit I guess!?!?</li> <li>Then what after we NLP</li> <li>We find people talking about matching stuff</li> <li>We can find any two people and see what they talk about and shit</li> <li>We will have to generate infographics and suff</li> <li>Do we do this in a separate repo!?!?</li> <li>Ummmmmmmmm</li> <li>yes, we already have the code here, now we need to do the ETL which can get messy, this code is very clean</li> <li>We also need to package this project</li> <li>Added to the list of shit to do</li> <li>Alright we use the sqlitedatabase then run every message through the ETL pipeline thing then save each object that comes out in a table</li> <li>Shit you make it sound easy</li> <li>What git repo!?!?</li> <li>No we just make a folder</li> <li>What does our table look like!?!?!?!?</li> <li>Alright we doing a script or a class?</li> <li>A class, isin't that the correct way to do things</li> <li>Isn't it over complicating things</li> <li>It's more pythonic and helps organize shit, if you use OO langauge use OO</li> <li>Alright where is our NLP code</li> <li>Alright we have the table, we have the messages</li> <li>Wait don't messages have a UUID or something</li> <li>We doing group or team messages first?</li> <li>Why we do group messages</li> <li>Let's start by circling through all the messages</li> <li>Then we practice on a single message with the NLP</li> <li>Then loop through the NLP</li> <li>What if we cancle message halfway through</li> <li>We need a primary key for this stuff</li> <li>We can use conversation_id + sent_at_ms as a primary key</li> <li>That will be a little long, who cares</li> <li>Are we checking for every message</li> <li>Over engineering but yes let's do it</li> <li>Also we are going to probably want to load these into memory</li> <li>If you are doing that just migrate to spark</li> <li>I don't really like spark cause everything has to be memory based then saving, I can do memory with sqlite</li> <li>Come up with a project large enough for spark</li> <li>Alright quest accepted</li> <li>Alright so what are we doing?</li> <li>Looping through the messages</li> <li>I really gotta work on documenting this shit</li> <li>Are you going to put that data into the graph database</li> <li>Well I need to know what kind of queries I want to do first don't I</li> <li>I just want to match the entity and word</li> <li>Can't you just do a SQL query for that</li> <li>But we need two different entities</li> <li>We are matching within the same table</li> <li>SQL can do this</li> <li>Then tell me a story about graph databases</li> <li>Alright what's on the backlog?</li> <li>Well why don't we just list all the text that comes out</li> <li>We need to start using a jupyter notebook</li> <li>So we want to list how many time each unique entity appears</li> <li>Sounds like a SQL query to me</li> <li> <p>Let'w write it      ``` sql     SELECT         message_id,         result_json,         json_extract(result_json, '$.word')     FROM nlp_messages_t     WHERE result_json NOT NULL;</p> <p>SELECT     A.message_id,     B.message_id,     json_extract(A.result_json, '$.entity'),     json_extract(A.result_json, '$.word'),     json_extract(B.result_json, '$.word') FROM     nlp_messages_t A, nlp_messages_t B WHERE     json_extract(A.result_json, '$.word') = json_extract(B.result_json, '$.word')     AND json_extract(A.result_json, '$.entity') = json_extract(B.result_json, '$.entity');</p> <p>```     * Alright how do we do now?     * You should probably go for a walk or something     * We actually have something to read in the journal     * Alright what next?     * You going to wait for data you don't even trust     * Also you did the code correctly this time so you can restart it later     * True     * What other datasets do I want to play with?     * Discord Data, Twitter, ActivityPub     * Why do you want all this data     * I am looking for people to work with     * Work with on what what kind of change do you want to see in the world     * I want to see this Daemon thing built     * Go watch some Persona 4     * I wan to know more about BERT models     * My goal is to relate to people in new and interesting ways     * Alright we found matching words and entities     * You should fix the ID, it is hard to find the messages, add the topic_or_group_name     * Do we want to output to two different tables?     * Why make things complicated     * Alright we add columns, is_team, team_name, topic_or_group_name, conversation_id, chat_id     * No we want separate team and group chats because we can export the data and share it easier     *  * 2023-01-13     * Alright do we want everything as JSON files or do we want to commit to SQLite, sqlite is built into python     * Actually do we have any pip packages at this point?     * This matters right now because we have to parse the attachments from the existing messages then pull them out one by one     * It would be way easier if we had a single table with all the JSON and messages and stuff, just like dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/ActivityWatch     * Well we are going to put the data into sqlite eventually, and it is easy to parse out the sqlite data into something like potgres or elasticsearch programatially rather than just file dumping everything     * So you wana rewrite the entire application to store data in sqlite     * It will just be more beautiful, rather than folders of files we have sqlite     * Do you really want a mess of files or do you want a beautiful sqlite database, one file and the zipped extensions     * Ya sqlite is the way to go, but not over done     * Alright we doing a schema for this now     * YES     * We need example code     * We need to do this all in the constructor     * Do we want a new keybase export class     * No     * For SQL messages, do I want to get them all or do the pagiation 1000 each time     * 1000 each time for sure     * Alright we go the sqlite migration done, that was done in one day, good job     * What is next?     * We search for attachments in sqlite * 2023-01-12     * How do we want to deal with teams?     * We have each team have a JSON file in the root directory with their name then have a folder with the files     * Ya that works * 2023-01-11     * Working on Keybase Binding     * Alright what is the work log     * Dentropy you need a gittea server for you code     * No just use built in github stuff     * Crap you are right     * No we do it here for now     * Wait we have a list that can go right into the project trakcer easily * 2023-01-10     * Hello world, here I am over a year later     * It is your neurotic pal dentropy here to work on a project that has his own name on it that isin't getting anywhere     * I feel like I have learned a couple thing over the last year and bit, about myself, about people     * What is the relationship between software and the people that use it?     * Software in feedback loops that operate on either an individual level or a collective level     * The Medium is the message     * The dentropydaemon is supposed to be a new medium we use to relate to ourselves and others with additional context     * I really need to get the capitalization on that right     * I like dentropydaemon cause dd is a linux command     * It should probably be Dentropy Daemon but I can take the liberty to do DentropyDaemon     * Do I remember how Nouns work in english?     * Nope     * Alright doesn't matter actually deliver something and someone else will decide for you     * There is no successful software with corresponding psyop     * Developing software as a single person is easy     * Developing software as a group can be difficult     * Developing software then marketing it is a separate story I am not familar with and likely filled with corruption     * But what do people want from their software?     * The software today is like a mood organ from dentropydaemon-wiki/Media/List/do androids dream of electric sheep     * Alright what is the Dentropy Daemon?     * All your metadata in a single queriable system that can also be queried by others     * Why don't your deploy that image app what was it called?     * dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Photoprism then put everything you have there     * Also deploy wallabag     * These things have API's that can be pulled together     * Then get a Calibre server with all your ebooks     * You already have AudioBookShelf for your audiobooks  * Does that have a API     * I have all this data and don't use it to actually shape the world     * That is because you don't know what you want the world to look like     * No I have ideas and values I want to spread, I have just nudered myself to a certain point because I know no one cares about what I care about     * This is going to be cliche but you need to think like Steve Jobs, you need to tell people what they want     * I need to use OSINT tools to find people that would want to work with me and have similar interests.     * I can get the git repos of all my favourite projects then find all the people that work on them then find them on social media them try to productively engage them in a public space     * I could gain a following this way     * Is that a data engineering project that can be completed in a short amount of time with clear deliverable results that involves chaining tools together in a way that has not exactly been done before     * YES     * Nice     * The DentropyDaemon is supposed to help me learn more about myself, like if I had a backdoor to the NSA I would use it to find specific kinds of people     * What kinds of people?     * Hmmm ones with Homelab's, One's that actually contribute to open source, one's that engage in communits I want to be a part of, one's that have similar ideology that kind of stuff     * So you are going to do an audit on yourself by figuring out where you belong!?!?!?     * Ya basically, plus I already have the tools for this somewhere     * Remember the end goal of DentropyDaemon is to have a digital representation of my psyche that I can pull out and play with and give access to others.     * Alright here is the project I did with Git, dentropy/udacity-capstone     * But we do not want to do that this time, we want to deal with an old fashioned SQL database in a way that is easily migratable     * Can I extract a ORM template for a database that already exists, I should     * Does this matter, am I using an ORM the way it is supposed to be used!?!?!?     * No you are going to write raw SQL anyways and you should, this is not an API     * Alright what next?     * Why don't we make a list of 100 of my favorite open source project, no no no, we go through my list of tools on dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Raindropio as well as list all the other ones I like to use     * We can write a script to query raindrop or we can export everything and process it     * Ya that works     * Alright so what are the deliverables * Export Raindrop, or sign up for it to export * Then pull out all the tools in a jupyter notebook * Then sort them by how much I like them * Then see if I can write a description to them * Oooo Raindrop has an API     * What feels off about this ima mediate on it     * The problem I feel is that I have not catalogued or index where all my data is, how much of it exists, what format it is, what services it is on     * You know I can store sqlite databases inside my cloud storage provider with little to no fuss.......     * I should develop my own coding curriculum or education program * And have a skill tree for myself     * Wow there is a really cool migraiton tool to move stuff from facebook, reddit, instagram, and twitter to raindrop     * Should I try it on my account?     * Ummm let's do sqlite databases first     * Wait what are we doing     * Pulling everything from Raindrop that has the URL github or has git in the URL as well as anything under TOOLS, I may need to label them open source     * I should repackage the dentropydaemon keybase project with search     * The thing could just be static HTML pages and JSON like I want to do with facebook and other social media exports.     * Alright decide on one thing and do it.     * This project needs a story     * Intro OSINT     * Well we just want to sort out my tools I find interesting, we need catagories, there is no point in having a list of tools unless they actually get used     * Alright I do not like this project, we get perople's emails from git repos, then search them up on OSINT tools, then find other info about them     * I wanted to do NLP stuff, I already have exports from keybase and discord and those are easy to get and that builds on top of the dashboard I already have up and running     * If I get a next gen dashboard I can start looking for another job because I will have ETL pipelines I can spin up on a whim.     * Can I do ETL pipelines in Gitlab CI?     * That does not matter, what matters is having a way of getting the data then automating it later     * You can have self destructing docker containers     * Serverless is what I am thinking of     * Alright skills to learn     * Dentropy write tutorials     * Subconscious I need to focus     * Alright what are we doing     * We are indexing keybase to sqlite via python this is version 4, and this time we are indexing everything     * Where are out previous attempts     * Document this shit bro * daily.journal.2021.10.31   * 13:40     * I see a vision in the mirror for what the the dentropy daemon is supposed to be. It is a bigger idea than me yet I am the only one working on it. I am a mediocre project manager at best therefore am currently unqualified to lead a project like this. I may be saying that because my metacognition assumes that good leaders don't want to be leaders. Either way there is a vision, reality, and imbalance between the two.     * I need to get these ideas planted into some communities to get some feedback       * Community.list.Conclience Project       * Community.list.Ryerson Zone System       * Community.list.Creative Destruction Lab       * Community.list.Citizen Lab       * Relationships.Relationship Catagories.Tower of Thiel#tower-of-thiel     * Alright we have a vision and a set of people we need to move through in order to gain influence, power, and experience     * This is still not specific enough to support wiki.concepts.list.Theory of Mind     * Should I create a personality section of this dendron?     * YES     * Adding to TODO list butts</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"76261f75-3052-4d74-b15e-2468789911b6/","title":"Prople have ideas and ideas have people","text":"<ul> <li>The failed startup founder is an idea that has a person</li> </ul>"},{"location":"7653ea39-650c-4c3e-af9a-f322ed27f2ce/","title":"How to solve RClone S3 Storage is not working as expected bug when backing up Discord Data?","text":""},{"location":"7653ea39-650c-4c3e-af9a-f322ed27f2ce/#example-command","title":"Example Command","text":"<pre><code>\nrclone sync ~/DiscordScraping/DiscordData raw-discord-data:raw-discord-data --s3-list-chunk 500\n\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"7653ea39-650c-4c3e-af9a-f322ed27f2ce/#logs","title":"Logs","text":"<pre><code>\u279c  ~ rclone sync ~/DiscordScraping/DiscordData raw-discord-data:raw-discord-data --s3-list-chunk 500      \n2023/10/03 17:37:03 ERROR : $GUILD_ID/$Guild_Name - OFFICIAL \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac - \ud83d\udea8\u2502minor-announcements [1048586302980886560].json_Files/267198358dbc223d888e0cb1cf2eb234-21157.png: Failed to copy: expected element type &lt;Error&gt; but have &lt;html&gt;\n2023/10/03 17:37:26 ERROR : $GUILD_ID/$Guild_Name - OFFICIAL \u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac - \ud83d\udea8\u2502minor-announcements [1048586302980886560].json_Files/334ac5f99e4355495ade4cc2fb64311d-B3947.png: Failed to copy: expected element type &lt;Error&gt; but have &lt;html&gt;\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"7653ea39-650c-4c3e-af9a-f322ed27f2ce/#research","title":"Research","text":"<ul> <li>What do I get when I search the error online?<ul> <li>The command is slow and returns an error \u00b7 Issue #5166 \u00b7 rclone/rclone<ul> <li>Tested did not work</li> </ul> </li> <li>moveto hangs on big files with s3 (provider: minio) \u00b7 Issue #7144 \u00b7 rclone/rclone<ul> <li><code>rclone sync ~/DiscordScraping/DiscordData raw-discord-data:raw-discord-data   --s3-copy-cutoff 512M</code></li> <li><code>rclone sync ~/DiscordScraping/DiscordData raw-discord-data:raw-discord-data   --disable copy</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <pre><code>\u279c  ~ rclone sync ~/DiscordScraping/DiscordData raw-discord-data:raw-discord-data   --s3-copy-cutoff 512M\n2023/10/03 17:54:44 ERROR : $GUILD_ID/$Guild_Name - \u21a3 Lux Official \u21a2 - \ud83d\udd0a\u2503\ud835\udda0\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddc8\ud835\uddce\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddbc\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc6\ud835\uddbe\ud835\uddc7\ud835\uddcd\ud835\uddcc [1017402092052287568].json_Files/c65850262478d9a6448cb534c5db56fe-423FD.png: Failed to copy: expected element type &lt;Error&gt; but have &lt;html&gt;\n\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Potential Work Around's<ul> <li>Pipe <code>rclone</code> output to file, parse out error files, create tar archive for files, upload to S3<ul> <li>This involves capturing and processing logs which is a skill I want to work on</li> </ul> </li> <li>Create tar archives for each guild and upload those to S3 in addition to the individual files<ul> <li>This option will take up a lot of additional storage we still want the raw attachments to be still available on object storage</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"766d2aac-bcb3-4b91-a029-537e834f2816/","title":"Questions for DAO's","text":"<ul> <li>Who are you trying to coordinate?</li> <li>What are you trying to produce?<ul> <li>What are the steps to produce that?</li> <li>How is this currently being produced?</li> </ul> </li> <li> Who will find value in what the DAO produces?</li> <li>Who will be the first people to produce for the DAO?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"766d2aac-bcb3-4b91-a029-537e834f2816/#brainstorming","title":"Brainstorming","text":"<ul> <li>Who deployed the token contract?</li> <li>Who are the founding members?</li> <li>Who first bought the token?</li> <li>What is the mission statement?</li> <li>What are similar projects?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"766d2aac-bcb3-4b91-a029-537e834f2816/#community-member-questions","title":"Community Member Questions","text":"<ul> <li>What are they doing</li> <li>How are they achieving it</li> <li>Try and understand their work flow</li> <li>Don't sell anything, LISTEN, ASK QUESTIONS, DON;T EXPLAIN HOW YOU WOULD DO IT</li> <li>How do you do your community management</li> </ul>"},{"location":"766d2aac-bcb3-4b91-a029-537e834f2816/#other-quesitons","title":"Other Quesitons","text":"<ul> <li>What do you think is good about this project</li> <li>What value do you see in this project</li> <li>What do you think is stupid about this project</li> <li>Design Process<ul> <li>Objective of the Discussion</li> <li>Frame the issue properly, what are you trying to achieve</li> <li>Generate Alternatives?

Where is god amongst all our technology? Why are we here? You did not choose to be here. Free will does not exist. Mankind is a stepping stone towards the internet of all things. Delusions hold human industrial society together. Delusions allow humanity to have shared goals. Even when one sees how the world works there is basically nothing they can do to shape it. No one said free will was easy. The puzzle pieces are all lying there on the ground for one to see. It only takes a relatively smart person to notice the puzzle pieces are there. It takes a genius to be self aware enough to start putting the puzzle pieces together. People are processors in some cosmic super computer running 200,000 year old firmware. </p> <p>Most people are NPC(Non player character)s void of free will reacting to their environment like a rat in a maze. There is this beautiful rolling release schedule for the collective human mind which started around the time of the enlightenment. The enlightenment was the best patch of the game so far. The enlightenment was a meta collection of memes which together treated people as information processors and society as an information processing system. Before the enlightenment the feudal system was a pretty great way of managing the world. The feudal system was relatively stable able to transfer its structure from one generation of meme lords to the next. Sadly the feudal system was not the most optimal. The illusion of freedom makes surfs much more productive, happier, and valuable. Chaotic systems can be self stabilizing.</p> <p>People fit into mostly pre defined narratives. We are all products of our environment and experiences. Our brains are bayesian reasoning machines. Our brains can only take in the information our bodies are exposed to. Evolution does not favor systems that represent the universe as it is but what systems that survive. Everyone is just trying to survive. The memes that form a person's persona are trying to survive the same way that individual and their gene's are trying to survive. Trying to change a person's course is like trying to climb up a very slippery water slide. The same way that an individual can find the puzzle pieces and climb up the water slide a individual can find the puzzle pieces of another person and try to spoon feed them.</p> <p>One does not want to be told they are plot armor it is very patronizing. In order to wield plot armor one must gather information on their tools to see how they tick. People are all just trying to survive and the second law of thermodynamics holds true. People like particles naturally flow towards the lowest energy state. Survival is a tricky concept. Technically speaking we can throw people in cages and give them enough food and they will quote on quote survive but that is not very productive is it? Survival has a wide range of possibilities from overcomplicated apes in cages to harrems every day at noon. There is one equation that helps guide us as humans and that is the meaning equation.

An example of elite overproduction is how we generate too many qualified people compared to the elite positions within society. So basically by making too many qualified people you stop the creation of true new elites because of too many cooks in the kitchen. When you think about it a physics lab is like a kitchen where people are trying to come up with new recipes in the form of experiments. Too many physics in the lab, too many cooks in the kitchen. Does this analogy not really make sense? Cooks only have to create so many dishes. When there are too many cooks, there are too many options for how to cook the same dish the best way. The task requires everyone work together. Rather than working together they can't make effecient decisions. They all want to make the most interesting complicated dish rather than dishes that are modular, have similar ingredients, etc, etc.</p>"},{"location":"80d8b309-f444-49be-9d83-cdf0776eeec7/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Elite overproduction - Wikipedia</li> <li>Elite Underproduction</li> <li>Overcoming Bias : What is \u2018Elite Overproduction\u2019?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"80f08cba-aef6-4b53-9c29-c4babb4d88a1/","title":"Imbalance - DentropyCloud","text":"<p>We need to start by understanding the problem.

Updating his model, we may add juxtaposing, as when several open windows allow one to read across several texts, and scanning, as when one reads rapidly through a blog to identify items of interest. There is considerable evidence that hyperreading differs significantly from typical print reading, and more-over that hyperreading stimulates different brain functions than print reading. -- dentropydaemon-wiki/Media/List/sphygm.us</p>"},{"location":"86cef5db-02ab-4632-ad1d-6141a185f418/","title":"DAO #blockchain dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Solidity dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Research/DAOs/DAO Protocols and Platforms/Snapshot","text":"<p>Supported networks - Developer Docs</p>"},{"location":"86cef5db-02ab-4632-ad1d-6141a185f418/#questions","title":"Questions","text":"<ul> <li>How can I add/remove an owner to gnosis-safe wallet from solidity smart contract?

The problem is even after taking Unix, database, and server administration courses in college installing these apps is still out of reach for many students and even graduates. The goal of our project is to reduce the barrier to entry for individuals to securely run server applications wherever they like in a scalable and redundant fashion. </p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>Together these apps are feature parity with the services provided by Big Tech.</p> <p>Before we dive into the technical details let's dive into these so-called apps. As an alternative to google drive and office 356 we have our choice of NextCloud, OwnCloud, Pydio with either OnlyOffice or Collabora office integrations. Moodle is basically open-source blackboard and used by educational institutions larger than George Brown. Monica is your personal CRM. Bitwarden the best password manager. And the best part is every app listed here, and many more, is already packaged and with a little know how can be installed by you today using our project.</p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>Only office and Collabora office are apps with plugins to nextcloud, owncloud, and pydio which provide real time collaborative document editing just like google docs. We have choice of nextcloud, owncloud and pydio as your cloud office suite and cloud file manager. Onlyoffice or Collabora office can plug into your self hosted office suite and provide collaborative document editing similar to google docs. </p> <p>Then there is the Fediverse which provides a feature a parity replacement to social media as we know it and Dentropy Cloud makes installing these apps more approachable.</p> <p>And then there is the Fediverse, social media as a protocol. The Fediverse apps listed on this slide provide similar functionality to twitter, reddit, Instagram, YouTube, and discord but there is a catch. Most those apps actually speak the same protocol activity pub making social media backwards compatible. This means you can do the equivalent to commenting on a YouTube video using a Facebook account or message a reddit user using a twitter account. By the end of this semester, we hope to radically simplify the installing of Fediverse apps.</p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>You are probably not going to trust a stranger on the internet to run your social media app but with the fediverse you have a choice to trust the stranger, run it yourself, or trust your techie friend's server.</p> <p>Our project was an excuse to learn Kubernetes.

There are all thoughts I will keep in mind for future testing, the moral of the story is, commit as infrequently as possible, and using execute_batch makes a meaningful difference.</p>"},{"location":"88dd3df8-6f60-40a4-b124-5bbcaf6e6128/","title":"005","text":""},{"location":"88dd3df8-6f60-40a4-b124-5bbcaf6e6128/#write-100-fascinations-that-you-can-use-for-the-sales-page-listed-below","title":"Write 100 Fascinations that you can use for the sales page listed below","text":"<p>Use as many Deep Work Sessions as needed to reach the target of 100 initial Fascinations</p> <ul> <li>Here is the Sales Page for reference - </li> <li>Google Drive - This scientifically-balanced focus pill is the closest thing to inspiration in a bottle | Neurohacker Collective.pdf</li> <li>https://neurohacker.com/qualia-mind-essentials-inspiration-in-a-bottle#annotations:FhSCTjOIEe2L98OxhDu4QQ</li> <li> <p>Annotated Article - This scientifically-balanced focus pill is the closest thing to inspiration in a bottle | Neurohacker Collective</p> </li> <li> <p>Become mentally strong by taking this secret pill</p> </li> <li>Nootropics the key to becoming the top 1% at whatever you do</li> <li>Not all performance enhancing drugs are banned substances, learn about how nootropics can change your life</li> <li>Do you get the mid afternoon energy low, learn how nootropics, Coffee 2.0, can help with that</li> <li>Coffee is 100's of years old, nootropics are coffee 2.0</li> <li>The quickest way to get into focus, nootropics</li> <li>The secret to flow is not just diet and working out, learn more about nootropics</li> <li>Hack the regime of attention with nootropics</li> <li>These people say nootropics were the key for them achieving self actualization</li> <li>With focus and this secret drugs you can learn how to reprogram yourself</li> <li>Fortune 100 CEO's are 500% more effective in flow and Qualia is guarenteed to boost flow</li> <li>In today's age focus is the key to happienes and qualia can help you get there</li> <li>Have you already hacked your diet, learn how nootropics can take you to the next level</li> <li>Lean about the secret LEGAL drugs billionares take to enhance their performance</li> <li>Nootropics and physical performance, a deep dive into the new health craze</li> <li>Working hard and working smart, how nootropics allow you to do both</li> <li>Learn about these secret new foods that allow you to hack your brain</li> <li>Context switching tiring you out, learn how nootropics can help</li> <li>Are you tired of not being your best self, learn about how nootropics can help</li> <li>Do nootropics reprogram the microbiome, a deep dive</li> <li>Get a leg up on your rival by taking nootropics</li> <li>Caffeine 2.0 has been in the market for over 20 years and nobody knows about it</li> <li>Caffeine is actually one of many cognitive enhancing substances, learn about the field of nootropics</li> <li>Nootropics Deep Dive, Qualia, First Person, and Alpha Brain</li> <li>Scam or miracle drugs, are nootrpics startups worth all the hype</li> <li>Drugs are what made us human, learn about the new field of nootropics</li> <li>Psychonaut's are consciousness explorer's, learn how nootropics can help you explore your subconscious</li> <li>The average person can't pass the turing test, learn how qualia can help us be more human</li> <li>Nootropics and sex, sharing my personal experience</li> <li>Are you losing your mental edge in your 40's learn how nootropics can help you get it back</li> <li>Senor citizens are getting a new view on life after taking nootropics</li> <li>The performance enhancing drugs of the ancients are making a come back, learn more about these special nootropics</li> <li>When is the optimal time to take nootropics?

A killer feature of using daemon apps is that within a few clicks one can open their daemon to the public interwebs. Suddenly the music app a single user was using can be used by anyone via their daemon URL, for example alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be the users dameon URL homepage but music.alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be alex smith's music application. A user running their music app on the daemon platform allows them to know exactly who is accessing the data they host because their app is a full felched application running on the cloud in their own container. Now rather than have apps running on a device dependent on some third party's cloud the application surface can be the cloud itself.

The vision for Dentropy Daemon - Home is to take all ones data into a single extendable API that the user and only the user has access and control over. Our computers function as our second and or outboard Brain yet our data is spread out all over the place making us all scatter brained. Once securely putting our Second Brain back together we can give it the ability to run programs in the background monitoring the data coming in from you, the internet, and others. Unhooking our data from platforms and replacing said platforms with protocols will allow for more human centric computation.</p> <p>Dentropy Cloud Description is a different way of running applications. The apps we all use on the web and on our phones don't really run on our phones they run or are dependent on someone's server.

I want to live in a world where we use domain names as our identity, I have the domain name dentropy.xyz and if someone knows that domain name that should be able to directly communicate with me rather than using a middle man. Rather than fracturing out identities across platforms like twitter, telegram, discord, and linkedin we connect to one another we manage our own domain names and run our own social media protocols.

On dentropy cloud users get their own daemon. On ones daemon one can install containerized applications which would function like apps. One can install a music hosting server, upload their music, then use it on any device logged into their daemon. Ones daemon is available through any web browser or one can install apps that plug into the daemon framework. A killer feature of using daemon apps is that within a few clicks one can open their daemon to the public interwebs. Suddenly the music app a single user was using can be used by anyone via their daemon URL, for example alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be the users dameon URL homepage but music.alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be alex smith's music application. A user running their music app on the daemon platform allows them to know exactly who is accessing the data they host because their app is a full felched application running on the cloud in their own container. Now rather than have apps running on a device dependent on some third party's cloud the application surface can be the cloud itself. Install the Pleroma social media app and get the same functionality as twitter plus know who views your server, how long, and what they did.

Ladder</p> <ul> <li>Email is a powerful platform for customer communication, and good email skills are transferable</li> <li>Once someone has signed up for a brand's email list, they are now part of that brand's \"world\"</li> <li>If a business can build and maintain a strong relationship with these people</li> <li>If they can shift their beliefs and inspire action towards their reader's goals</li> <li>The business can earn fans for life and will be able to achieve both a high LTV and huge scale.</li> <li>Different Kinds of Email Sequences</li> <li>Welcome Sequence<ul> <li>When someone opts in and takes their first step into your world</li> <li>You want to start hyper-building the relationship with them by providing value and by building rapport</li> <li>This kind of email sequence is often called an \"Indoctrination Sequence\" because you also take this time to reshape their view of the world</li> <li>Every brand has their take on what reality is</li> <li>The goal of a Welcome Sequence is to take a brand new person who isin't familiar with you or your brand</li> <li>Build a relationship with them, reshape their understanding of the world and prepare them to purchase the next product in the Value Ladder</li> <li>First email is a simple introduction and the actual \"bait they signed up for\"</li> <li>You will also want to tease the content they will be getting in the next email so that they will want to come back and read it</li> <li>Second email is usually a HSO email where they get the opportunity to know the guru/brand's discovery story and shift some beliefs</li> <li>You can make all of the CTAs in each email link directly to the next product in the Value Ladder</li> <li>OR you can simply make them \"Value Emails\" where you teach a small lesson or direct to some type of media asset like a Youtube Video.</li> <li>Third email is often some type of pure Value Email that gives the reader new knowledge about their Roadblocks and What needs to happen if they want to get to their Dream State</li> <li>This can be done with the DIC format and then either reveal the answer instead of driving the click or have them discover the answer on a directed page or video outside the email.</li> <li>Fourth email is usually a DIC email focussed 100% on driving the newly educated and excited reader to go to the sales page</li> <li>Fifth email is usually a PAS style email to help people over the edge now that they have been to the Sales Page for your upsell product.</li> <li>You can have more than 5 emails, or less</li> <li>It's up to you to decide what steps the reader needs to experience between opting in for the original value and being ready to be sold to for the next product.</li> <li>Even if the reader doesn't buy the next product, they should be \"bought\" in to the brand and trained to enjoy opening the businesses emails.</li> <li>You want the person bought into the brand even if they do not buy immediately</li> <li>Remember pavlov's dog</li> <li> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Normal Newsletter Emails</li> <li>While this isn't exactly a \"sequence\", it is important to keep the relationship with your list alive and continue to sell/help them with your other products.</li> <li>Be their guide</li> <li>You are going to want to make the majority of your emails to your list about helping them rather than only sending direct sales emails</li> <li>You are building up a relationship \"bank account\" so that you can eventually make a withdrawal by asking them to look at and byy a product or service from you.</li> <li>But even though these are \"Value\" emails does not mean that you should ignore the DIC, PAS, and HSO elements</li> <li>You can also tag on a mini CTA in the PS section of your Value emails to capture sales as you educate and help</li> <li>But usually you want a 2:1/3:1 ratio of Value emails to Sales emails to your list</li> <li>Launch Sequence</li> <li>When a business is going to launch a new product or hold alive/paid event, they will often send a series of emails to their list to build up demand and capture the maximum number of sales.</li> <li>In many ways these sequences are a lot like the Welcome Sequence</li> <li>There is usually an announcement email a few weeks before the product becomes available encouraging pre orders.</li> <li>If there is a sale period or time limited access, there are also usually some high urgency PAS style emails that go out at different times letting the reader know there are 48 hours left, or 24 hours left etc.</li> <li>Many businesses run several launch cycles per year for their products in this way.</li> <li>Reactivation Sequence</li> <li>Over time subscribers will lose interest, and will stop opening up your emails</li> <li>Google and Mail servers keep track of open rates and spam complaints</li> <li>If you keep sending email to people who don't ever open it, your're sending domain/address will get black listed and they will stop treating your emails as priority</li> <li>So if there is a lott of old subscribers who aren't responsive on your list, you need to identify them and give them a chance to reintegrate or clean them out of your list.</li> <li>You're going to first segment the subscribers who haven't opened any emails in X number of months</li> <li>Then you're going to send them a series of emails letting them know they are going to be removed from your list.<ul> <li>And then inviting them to take X action to stay on</li> <li>(Usually that means clicking a link saying they want to stay)</li> <li>You can also \"bribe\" them to stay by offering them a small discount on one of your products</li> <li>Or \"re-indoctrinate\" them by building their curiosity and desire to consume some content similar to the Welcome Sequence to get them to engage in the \"world\" of the brand</li> <li>But eventually you need a \"break up email\", a final last chance to stay</li> <li>Words without action are meaningless, remember that</li> </ul> </li> <li>Segmentation</li> <li>Email Marketing Software like EMS, Mailchimp, Active Campaign etc. allow you to segment your list based on behavior</li> <li>For example if they click a specific link, open an email, visit a page on your site, buy a specific product etc..</li> <li>You can tag them and then treat them differently on your list</li> <li>In this way you can identify your best prospective customers for a specific product, or send one kind of email to the men and another to the women, etc.</li> <li>This ability to segment and tag your list will allow you to tailor the subscribers experience to them and allow to get the maximum value.</li> <li>A rule of thumb is a business should ear $1 for each subscriber on their list</li> <li>If you show up to help a business and they have 100,000 subscribers but are only making $20k/mo, then you know they need to improve their list health, improve their email sequences, and or add new products to get more value per contact.</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"937a6a80-fc9e-4598-89f1-a079aea52910/#todo-judge-all-the-newsletters-you-signed-up-to","title":"TODO judge all the newsletters you signed up

Its roots are mythical with deamon refering to a supernatural being working in the background. The field of computation stole this concept labeling background programs daemons. An example of a computer deamon is an email server. In order to recieve email or recieve print jobs there must always be a email or printer server daemon running.</p> <p>Now with rise of big data, survalence capitalisim, and the Snowden NSA leaks we now live in a world where it may be possible to combine these two definitions of daemon. What is every piece of digital information about us was gathered and plugged into a system that provided an algorithmic self reflection of who we are as a person. Every web search, post, message sent, message resieved, browsing history, photos taken, location history, and more would all be accessable to this system. This system would not only have access to your information but anybody who is not a privacy purist is plugged into said system. This system would be a background process for the hivemind of humanity itself.</p> <p>A system like this exists, we know is from the Snowden NSA Leaks. Access to the information generated by billions at people in the hands of a special elite few that the public does not achnowledge exists. I like to ask people what would they do with access to the NSA toolbox. Some say it must be destroyed like the ring in Lord of The Rings, many others have no idea. This blog is an experiment to discover what I would do with the Eye of Sauron.</p> <p>Let's just think about this for a second. If a system like this actually existed what would be possible? Covid 19 would have been solved a long time ago. Pedophilia and child porn would be radically different problems.</p> <p>Let's be frank guys, Big Tech, telecoms, the NSA, and Friends let Covid-19 continoue to spread. For telecoms and Big Tech to track every person with a phone in all the western world is a matter of flicking the right switch. The first question we would need to answer is if this data is already available and just need to be properaly organized. The easiest way to gather the location of basically everyone would be to go to Apple and Google and make them give you the infoamtion they already have. Google already explicity tracks everyone and if apple does not log everyone already would just need to start logging now. Between Google and Apple one would be able to track basically every phone in the western world. Now it is just a matter of correlating this information with Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>Now the question is is this information is good enough to track the spread of Covid-19. Our location is tracked many ways. The telecoms can triangulate ones locatios, GPS is built into every phone, one can look at the SSID (wifi names) around one self and generate a unique ID for their location  to be compared with ones, bluetooth, IP address, and MAC address. Oh and for those that don't know all those find my phone apps listen for other phones as long as your bluetooth is on.</p> <p>Wow there you might say what about my right to privacy? Well privacy is a concept from the 19th centary that doesn't work well in the digital age. If the average person actually cared about privacy they would be running linux on their desktop, these days it's not hard. If you are not running linux on your desktop just assume the daemon has direct access to your PC.</p> <p>Here are some scary thoughts to think about</p> <p>There is an unimaginable amount of child porn sitting on facebook, snapchat, and other online services. Most of it is likely not from pedofiles and other people that belong bars but children themselves. Sexting was pretty mainstream before Covid-19 but now that everyone is locked away from one another Sexting is likely more poplar than ever.</p>"},{"location":"9597719e-4990-4ce7-a6fc-7db6d61428e9/","title":"Scrape Linkedin","text":"<p>Linkedin has 3 separate entities I want to scrape * profiles * companies * jobs</p>"},{"location":"9597719e-4990-4ce7-a6fc-7db6d61428e9/#tooling","title":"Tooling","text":"<ul> <li>joeyism/linkedin_scraper: A library that scrapes Linkedin for user data<ul> <li>Not all of it works but some of it does</li> <li>Some of it works but not all of it</li> </ul> </li> <li>VishwaGauravIn/linkedin-jobs-api: \ud83d\udd25Advanced node.js package for getting job listings from LinkedIn \ud83d\udcbc<ul> <li>Tested and works</li> <li>This works, but only does job, I also want to know about companies</li> </ul> </li> <li>DrakenWan/Yale3: A simple LinkedIn profile scraper implemented as a chrome extension<ul> <li>Updated, but I need to test this one</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"9598c522-57cf-4bfe-9c30-70072f70bb93/","title":"Bash History","text":"<p>[[and Why|[and Why|[and Why|[and Why|and Why) to Log Your Entire Bash History</p>"},{"location":"959c1ce5-8183-40dc-ba26-613095263557/","title":"Programing Tutorials","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Languages</p> <ul> <li>Processing</li> <li>C, Arduino C</li> <li>A little Java</li> <li>Javascript</li> <li>Python</li> <li>Solidity</li> <li>bash</li> <li>CSS3?</li> <li>SQL</li> <li>Some PHP but basically none</li> <li>Markdown</li> <li>HTML</li> <li>XML</li> <li>Concepts in Programing</li> <li>Print</li> <li>if / else / elif</li> <li>loops<ul> <li>for</li> <li>while</li> <li>switch statement</li> <li>variable declaration</li> <li>data types</li> </ul> </li> <li>different types of numbers</li> <li>strings</li> <li>chars</li> <li>lists</li> <li>dictionary's / mappings</li> <li>recursion</li> <li>Take user input from command line</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"959c1ce5-8183-40dc-ba26-613095263557/#programing-links","title":"Programing Links","text":"<ul> <li>SQL</li> <li>bash</li> <li>javascript</li> <li>python</li> </ul>"},{"location":"95e0c650-f005-44b7-8e0f-c062d5805d19/","title":"setup","text":"<ul> <li>apps/ELK \u00b7 master \u00b7 Paul Mullins / DentropyCloud-traefik \u00b7 GitLab</li> <li>\u2b06\ufe0f uses -&gt; [GitHub - deviantony/docker-elk: The Elastic stack (ELK|[ELK|[ELK|[ELK|[ELK|ELK|[ELK|[ELK|[ELK|[ELK) powered by Docker and Compose.](/undefined) powered by Docker and Compose.]] powered by Docker and Compose.](ELK) powered by Docker and Compose. powered by Docker and Compose.]]%20powered%20by%20Docker%20and%20Compose.)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"95eaa7b6-77b1-424c-9f30-5824ad1d040e/","title":"Rubber Hand Illusion","text":"<p>'Rubber hand illusion' reveals how the brain understands the body | Neuroscience | The Guardian</p>"},{"location":"9614ef64-f63e-4552-8559-a9b1d2c3a65b/","title":"json2csv","text":"<p>wiki.software.list.nodejs.npm.json2csv</p>"},{"location":"962b5f3f-1b8f-4314-9dc4-ac71a5a41fcf/","title":"Average path length","text":"<p>Average path length - Wikipedia</p>"},{"location":"9650146a-1cc9-41b2-8dfe-f360ea702710/","title":"Istvan s 3 Laws of Transhumanisim","text":"<p>Istvan's Three Laws of Transhumanism are:</p> <ol> <li>A transhumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else.</li> <li>A transhumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible\u2014so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.</li> <li>A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe\u2014so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"9650146a-1cc9-41b2-8dfe-f360ea702710/#source","title":"Source","text":"<ul> <li>The Transhumanist Wager - Wikipedia</li> </ul>"},{"location":"96b74864-ae25-4506-85fc-07e68424be59/","title":"Transhumanist Wager","text":"<ol> <li>A Transgumanist must safeguard one's own existence above all else</li> <li>A trashumanist must strive to achieve omnipotence as expediently as possible - so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First Law.</li> <li>A transhumanist must safeguard value in the universe - so long as one's actions do not conflict with the First and Second Laws.</li> </ol> <p>I view these laws more as agreements one makes with themselves rather than laws.

Today, I am going to start resonating that cringe I introduced to the universe yesterday. I feel like I have been hanging out on a isolated island my entire life pretending to belong to a community I don't even interact with. I gotta say, I think my isolated island is pretty dope but once the self aware organ grows to the appropriate size one realizes there is no reasonable path to get from the undesirable present into the ideal future without a drastic course of action. </p> <p>Lots of people dream of being the drivers of their own lives, but where exactly are we all trying to drive? Where does one go to get directions? What are the different kinds of maps available? And who, are the mapmakers.</p> <p>As we discussed yesterday we are all busy driving bodies around. Where do these bodies with brains go to get directions? School, academia, media, books, the internet..... What are all these things made of.... other people. Hmmmm you know it's fun to think about governments, corporations, and even religions as a set of worker ants in the form of human bodies supporting the existence of an ephemeral ideological queen. Its fascinating to see people repeat the myths of religion, government, and sometimes, even science without an understanding of what they are thinking. Society seems to be mostly a game of he said she said being played by the collective bodies of these ephemeral myths. These myths, these are the maps.</p> <p>In 2021 you are either a collaborator or a dissident. Everything is about power. Power is like a ever expanding fractal cascading into the future taking on new shapes in the hope of preserving what was. Controlling what people do with their bodies. These maps in the shape of myths seem to have their own interests at heart, just like the bodies of the humans they inhabit.</p> <p>I want a map of what's going on. I know, the rabbit hole goes very deep. The universe is written by one hand after all. Contradictions do not exist. Whenever you think that you are facing a contradiction, check your premises.</p> <p>But maps are never really that accurate, there is always difference between the map, what one believes to be true, and the territory, our shared objective reality. These maps continue to perpetuate into the future because they live within their own ecosystem of natural selection. A lot of the time these maps give contradictory directions for what people should do with their bodies. And since the range of desireable human experiences is more a mountain range with a variety of peaks to climb than an objective reality these map's have issues existing on top of one another. In a sense the maps people use to decide what to do with their bodies are self interested. The maps choose to spieciate, fight, pillage, blackmail, and sometimes even annihilate deleting the other from existence. These bodies sure like to interact with one another in interesting ways.</p> <p>So how do we start studying these maps. Maps of what people should do with their bodies. What tools do we have at our disposal. What magic formulation of words will change what somebody does with their body. Well I got good starting place for us. There is a series of interfaces between all these maps, a creeping global ideology slowly encompassing all of us reaching into all of our brains like a parasite. Power.</p> <p>Here's a thought experiment we should all consider. If your actions were completely selfish, if you were an utterly egocentric sociopath, if your only goal was to get ahead and make a good impression ------ what would you pretend to believe? What words, what ideas, would drip from your mouth? And which bodies would you try and mimic on social media. </p> <p>Let's try and create a parody of what many people are pretending to become.</p> <p>No Meme File Found</p> <p>;</p>"},{"location":"9942049a-ce85-4b5d-b34f-ead6968a85b4/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Relationships.People.Curtis Yarvin</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Map vs Territory</li> <li>wiki.media.list.Atlas Shrugged</li> <li>wiki.media.list.The Alchemist</li> </ul>"},{"location":"9942049a-ce85-4b5d-b34f-ead6968a85b4/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Art is a reflection on society and the times \u2013 PantherNOW</li> </ul>"},{"location":"9946c9b6-7667-403f-bf89-b86530543279/","title":"ideology research","text":"<ul> <li>Research</li> <li>Ideology | Definition of Ideology by Merriam-Webster</li> <li>[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek on \"They Live\" (The Pervert's Guide to Ideology|The Pervert's Guide to Ideology) - YouTube - YouTube]]%20-%20YouTube)%20-%20YouTube)%20-%20YouTube)%20-%20YouTube)%20-%20YouTube)%20-%20YouTube)<ul> <li>It is not only our reality that enslaves us</li> <li>We experience ideology when we escape reality into our dreams</li> <li>We are subjects of pleasures, realize your true potential</li> <li>When you put the glasses on you see dictatorship in democracy</li> <li>Ideology is something that is in our way distorting our view</li> <li>Take off the glasses and see things the way really are</li> <li>It hurts to step out of ideology</li> <li>People are aware of the lie of ideology and that putting on the glasses will make people realize the lie</li> <li>\u201cYou must be forced to be free\u201d If you trust your spontaneous sense or whatever you will never get free.</li> </ul> </li> <li>ELI5: Ideologies? : explainlikeimfive<ul> <li>\u201cAn ideology is political system of thought.

A smartphone that is the cloud. A tool for normies to run their own secure fediverse communities. A place for nerds to export all their social media and analyse it. A place for one to not only run their second brain but for their second brain to make some friends.</p> <p>Using dentropy cloud should be as easy as using a smartphone just through a web browser. On dentropy cloud users get their own daemon. On ones daemon one can install containerized applications which would function like apps. One can install a music hosting server, upload their music, then use it on any device logged into their daemon. Ones daemon is available through any web browser or one can install apps that plug into the daemon framework. A killer feature of using daemon apps is that within a few clicks one can open their daemon to the public interwebs. Suddenly the music app a single user was using can be used by anyone via their daemon URL, for example alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be the users dameon URL homepage but music.alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be alex smith's music application. A user running their music app on the daemon platform allows them to know exactly who is accessing the data they host because their app is a full felched application running on the cloud in their own container. Now rather than have apps running on a device dependent on some third party's cloud the application surface can be the cloud itself. Install the Pleroma social media app and get the same functionality as twitter plus know who views your server, how long, and what they did.

G. Wells asked What are we to do with our lives? in \"The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution\". Wells believed that the existing social, political, and economic structures of his time were inadequate and unable to address the pressing challenges facing humanity. The book proposed the idea of an \"open conspiracy\" or a loosely organized movement of like-minded individuals working towards the establishment of a world order based on principles of \"science\", \"reason\", and \"social progress\".</p> <p>The ideas that H.G.Wells articulated almost 100 years ago are flourishing within the world of today. With the WEF, financial centralisation, power of multi national corporations, and centralised control over the means of communication we are heading towards Wells' vision of a \"global community\" managed by \"Science\", \"reason\", and \"social progress\". What society has failed to integrate since the publishing of \"The Open Conspiracy\" is the reactions to this \"global community\" as articulated in \"Brave New World\",  \"The Rediscovery of Man\", \"The Matrix\" and oh so many more.</p> <p>The world we live in is becoming all one big massively correlated experiment that has already grown to a level of complexity where we do not understand what is going on anymore. The experiment that is going on should be allowed to run but it should not create a system of massive inter dependence that can lead to a cascade of failing systems leading to a future dystopia that no human wants to live in.</p> <p>What values Humanity brings with it into its future is a very complex problem deserving of multiple solutions. There are many ways to play the human instrument, some resonate, some don't, there has to be a way for us all to live lives worth living.</p>"},{"location":"9b72d1b1-55ef-4c24-b41c-eaa3ff9c206f/#where-we-are-now","title":"Where We Are Now","text":"<p>Failed Networked and Crypto Dreams</p> <p>Back in the early 90's the wannabe technocrats on usenet expected direct democracy to scale using TCP/IP. Since Bitocin was released many cryptocurrency nerds have expected and are expecting Bitcoin to replace the US Dollar without a similar set of capable institutions backing it. Instead of direct democracy we got surveillance capitalism and psyops of the likes we have never seen before. Instead of crypto anarchy we got NFT scams and a couple decentralised finance proof of concepts. The fact is it is 2023 and most people on the blockchain still us public keys to send value to one another. PGP registries from the 90's are still the best way to message many people securely.</p> <p>Ideology is evolving and we lost the grip on the stories we tell ourselves</p> <p>Much of the stuff that is filling up the public narrative would be ridiculous five years ago and is basically unimaginable ten years ago. We are seeing more and more headlines that belong in an Ayn Rand novel. We are losing our perspective of history faster and faster. People are lost and don't know what to value anymore. Societies mental health is declining for many reasons but in my opinion the number one reason is the increacing complexity of the world without the heuristics to meaningfully navigate it.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 20th centary we had three stories humanity told itself, the fascist story, the communist story, and the liberal story. The Second World War knocked out the fascist story, and from the late 1940s to the late 1980s the world became a battleground between just two stories: communism and liberalism. Then the communist story collapsed, and the liberal story remained the dominant guide to the human past and the indispensable manual for the future of the world\u2014or so it seemed to the global elite. However, since the global financial crisis of 2008 people all over the world have become increasingly disillusioned with the liberal story. Walls and firewalls are back in vogue. Resistance to immigration and to trade agreements is mounting. Ostensibly democratic governments undermine the independence of the judiciary system, restrict the freedom of the press, and portray any opposition as treason. Strongmen in countries such as Turkey and Russia experiment with new types of illiberal democracies and outright dictatorships. Today, few would confidently declare that the Chinese Communist Party is on the wrong side of history.</p> <p>We are losing our ability to productively communicate</p> <p>When social media companies set up algorithms to optimize for attention spent on each of their walled gardens they did not foresee that it would would lead to political division and radicalisation. The time to start worrying about AI generated content on the internet is last year as we already AI content farms generating pretty watchable content on Youtube and that doesn't even get into Fake Internet Theory. Attention spans are degrading, people are now likely spending more time on TikTok than youtube or netflix.</p> <p>People are staring into their electronic devices being programmed by them because they can not critically engage with the software as it is designed today.</p> <p>%% - Attempts     - Are we living in a world we want to live in?

If I had practiced the ETL pipeline with synthetic data things might have worked out better.</p> <p>Only Postgres Design, using JSON tables like MongoDB</p> <p>JSON Files -&gt; JSON Postgres SQL Tables -&gt; Native Postgres SQL Tables -&gt; Any desired format</p> <p>As articulated in ETL to QE, Update 1, SQLite to Postgres I explained why I initially wanted to use JSON tables rather than native SQL tables. </p> <p>At this point when practicing loading the ETL pipline into the database I noticed it took hours to run even with The Optimizations therefore it was time to write some real SQL.</p> <p>Native SQL Postgres Design</p> <p>JSON Files -&gt; Native Postgres SQL Tables -&gt; Any desired format</p> <p>Just like when doing a calculus proof you arrive at a simple description at the end.</p>"},{"location":"9dd3667c-231c-43f1-81d6-b96adff4ea81/","title":"User Stories - DDaemon","text":""},{"location":"9dd3667c-231c-43f1-81d6-b96adff4ea81/#dentropy-daemon-user-stories","title":"Dentropy Daemon User Stories","text":"<p>Paul wakes up in the morning to the the sound of his daemon.

Things like a triple entendre have three meanings. Rather than cognitively processing that three meanings exist for a set of words why don't we attach an additional dimension or two to our media so we can get those meanings explicitly articulated.</p> <p>Just like how a single piece of music is never played exactly the same way twice the same can be said for a sentence being interpreted. Every person brings a unique context to the media they consume yet the essence of the message still remains. The message that remains is emergent and beyond what any single persona says about a piece of work. The context around a work usually says more than the work itself especially when people consume the thoughts and opinions of others who have consumed the work, recursively, creating a very interesting game of broken telephone of which we all engage.</p> <p>Every paragraph ever written can have 100's of questions asked about it. Sure some of these questions might have little value or context. Thing is though every person asks a different set of questions and sorts it in a completely unique way, just like how a song is never played the same way twice.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be cool if there was a piece of software that allowed everyone to question everything with minimum context switching!</p> <p>The Questions you ask usually reveal more about who you are than one reveals literally describing themselves. Questions reveals how one thinks while descriptions reveal how they wants to be seen. One problem, or more accurately feature, of the human condition is that we can't turn off our threat detection. Honey Badger may not care, but Human's, they tend to care. One must desire something in order to be alive otherwise they are just a conduit for others desires. Other's desires, that brings us to the next bug.... I mean feature.</p> <p>We are social creatures who can't explicitly communicate our intentions. Can you imagine if everyone acted how they were feeling? It wouldn't be very natural, just like the show Friends. This dichotomy between feeling and intentions on one side and whatever we tend communicate on the other is what makes humans so interesting. Acting one way and behaving another happens so often that is requires people fracture their psyches. This fracturing comes in the form of compartmentalization resulting in this cohesive concept of being an illusion. </p> <p>All the different personas we act as in different situations constitute different parts of us that react differently to our internal thoughts, feeling, and emotions. The performance we put on for others doesn't stop when we are by ourselves. The audience changes from other black boxes to simulacrum shadows of those black boxes hiding in our psyche we can't turn off.</p> <p>Wouldn't it be cool if software encouraged our different personas to engage with one another under clear supervision, possibly with the help of others!</p> <p>The person's we wield exist for one distinct purpose that makes us human, intelligence. It is said that, \"The test of a first rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.\" These Persona's maintain cognitive dissonance and allow us to act and survive in the world.</p> <p>Intelligence is more than thinking, thinking by itself is just cognition. Intelligence requires the capability to perform, capability to act, capability to navigate to ones desired goals. Intelligence requires decisions. The decisions we make are always surrounded by the context of the persona fragments derived from our interactions with others. So maybe design the persona you are performing for rather than the persona you want to be.</p> <p>I am supposed to be producing networks of memes that can be interacted with by others.</p> <p>Where is the map of memes?</p> <p>I have a four step plan to make this vision of commoditized context come true,</p>"},{"location":"9dfba51c-8092-411d-859b-9acf356ec385/#1-discord-analytics-reports-and-dashboard","title":"1.

Today I am going to practice dictating my vision for the #dentropyDaemon in order to get some critical feedback. Entropy and my understanding of it  What is entropy: Entropy is how systems of high order and complexity break down into systems of chaos and randomness. Entropy works by taking fast moving hot stuff and mixing it with slow moving colder stuff, producing stuff that moves at a speed and temperature in the middle. Examples of Entropy in daily life: An example of entropy is breaking an egg and scrambling it, the opposite of entropy would be taking the scrambled eggs and turning it back into an egg. </p> <p>To you and me entropy is not a big problem, sure one\u2019s room may get messy but one can always clean it up, a broken down house can be torn down and replaced by a new one. The problem with entropy is that the entire universe is becoming a big batch of scrambled eggs and those eggs will all turn into dust eventually leaving a universe void of life. The universe becoming void of life due to entropy is also referred to as the \u2018heat death\u2019 of the universe.</p> <p>Daemons and my understanding of it Let's start with a quick history of Daemons. The ancient Greeks had a concept of a personal daemon which functioned as a sort of guardian angel. The great philosopher Socraties had a daemon he described as an oracle always listening in that background would emerge to forbid him from doing certain things yet never commanded anything. In the 1800's a man named James Clerk Maxwell came up with the equations to describe the electromagnetic field known as Maxwell's Equations, he also came up with a fantastic thought experiment known as Maxwell's Daemon. The thought experiment known as Maxwell's Daemon postulated that information used under the right conditions can reverse the second law of thermodynamics, reversing entropy. The experiment places two boxes of gas at different temperatures next to one another and places a mystical daemon in control of a magic door between the two boxes of air. The Daemon opens the door to let slow moving particles (cold) into one of the boxes and fast moving particles (hot) into the other box. The symbolism of Maxwell's Daemon and the Greek conception of daemon's was integrated into the concept of daemon's used in computing. Within the world of computing Daemon's are background processes running on your computer. Computing daemons act just like Socraties and Maxwell's Demon, listening in the background until they are called upon for action. Examples of computing daemons include a program on your printer listening for print jobs, network daemons that keep your laptop and phone connected to the internet, or the daemon that listens for push notifications from different apps on your phone. I came up with the term dentropy to describe my two greatest fears, death and entropy, the heat death of the universe. I later realized that the term, \"dent\" was in dentropy which really resonates with the following quote, \"We're here to put a dent in the universe. Otherwise, why else even be here?\". Realizing I am a dent in the universe really helped me deal with my existential dread. Dentropy can also be thought of as de-dentropy, the opposite of entropy. After dealing with my existential dread I realized that there is a daemon running on all computers called a entropy daemon. The entropy daemon allows your computer to generate randomness which may not sound important but is actually used ALL the time. It is very difficult for computers to generate randomness so there exists a special program running in the background, a daemon, that collects all sorts of randomness within a computer's environment to produce randomness that any other program on your computer can use. The #dentropyDaemon is the opposite of the entropy daemon, it is a process running on your computer with the goal to bring order to one's life rather than randomness.</p> <p>But how is a background program, daemon, going to help bring order to one's life? Before I can answer that let's explore what exactly our relationship with our computers is. The fact is we are all already cyborgs using computers as part of our brain. It is one thing to use a computer as a calculator or phone book, but a device that can connect you to anyone on the planet from just about anywhere in seconds with real time communication or allow you to query billions of digital documents in fractions of a second with a search engine that is someone else. A person with a smartphone is different from a person without a smartphone, they may both be the same body and brain but they behave, act, and think differently. We are all cyborgs using computers and software to augment our thinking. In fact I would even go as far to argue that our computers and software even function as a digital second brain.</p> <p>The problem with the design of our computers and software today is that they fracture our digital brain into dozens of pieces. The goal of #dentropyDaemon is to consolidate all these pieces that make up our digital second brain so we can use them to make more intelligent decisions. But first let me give you a couple examples of what these pieces are...</p> <ul> <li>We message and call the same people via texting, social media, email, using other digital means.</li> <li>Our text messages, social media, and eamil are all seperate peices of our digital second brain.</li> <li>We consume media all over the place, spotify, your favorite podcast app, and then there is all the places people watch movies and TV shows.</li> <li>Each place we consume media is a seperate piece of our digital second brain.</li> <li>Every web browser seperately tracks our web browsing history separately.<ul> <li>Each browser one uses acts as a seperate piece of ones second brain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We use reccomendation algorithms generated from traffic we generate on different platforms such as youtube, amazon, netflix, twitter, and reddit.<ul> <li>Each platform is a seperate piece containing a seperate reflection of our preferences.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Our phones are tracking our location all the time. <ul> <li>Ones location over the last couple years by itself may not be that useful by itself but integrated with other pieces may be useful in making intelligent decisions.</li> </ul> </li> <li>We buy stuff all over the place, using different back accounts, online stores, and even crypto currency.</li> <li>Each transaction we make is a memory we store in our second brain.</li> </ul> <p>Consolidating all this information into a single system, or API, would allow for the creation of a unified digital second brain. From this system one would be able see a reflection of their past behaviors, preferences, and thoughts. I like to call this type of reflection an algorithmic reflection. An algorithmic reflection can be used by an individual to make intelligent decisions. Generating ones algorithmic reflection is just one component of the #dentropyDaemon one also needs to be able to iterate on their algorithmic reflection by interacting with their digital second brain.</p> <p>Let's take a quick detour here and talk about privacy. The consolidation of all digital information a person generates would not only be valuable to the individual but hackers and companies that make money from data. One can download all this information to their phone or laptop via an app but that is not easily accessible across devices , may take up a LOT of storage, and is not backed up. Some people may sign up to a platform they trust to consolidate all their information but many people won't trust such a system. People need to be able to run their own #dentropyDaemon on their own devices. One's #dentropyDaemon can be a website or app available on one's phone or laptop connecting to encrypted object storage in the cloud. One can run their own #dentropyDaemon they can access from any web browser. Then there is new technology known as Secure Enclave which allows people to run programs on servers other people own in a way where the people who own the server don't know what program their server is running. The technology to securely generate one's algorithmic reflection and run a digital second brain exists and just needs to be implemented properly. Now let's talk a look at what things would be possible with one's #dentropyDaeon. Rather than browsing reddit, hacker news, twitter, and RSS one can run their own meta recommendation algorithm across all those platforms that can be tuned to one's desires. Rather than logging into netflix, youtube, or Hulu to see what they recommend you can have a meta recommendation algorithm you can tune to find the exact type of video, TV Show, or movie you want to watch. Here's a thought, if you run your own recommendation algorithm you can have different versions tuned different ways and share them with other people. Finding something to watch with a group of friends would never be easier when everyone's watch history can be combined into a single recommendation algorithm.</p> <p>If one's #dentropyDaemon is able to read one's data why can't it write data as well. Rather than using a different interface to message people and via email, facebook, keybase, telegram, and discord we can have an API that bridges to all these platforms allowing developers to create apps that can message people and groups on a selection of those platforms. I would use a feature like this to upload and publish videos to youtube, odyssey, and peertube all in one go. Since #dentropyDaemon will be able to read and write to multiple platforms and protocols one will be able to tell their #dentropyDaemon to migrate their existing tweets on twitter to another platform or protocol. One would eventually share their biases, preferences, interests, attributes, skills, thoughts, relationships, questions, heuristics with their #dentropyDaemon. One's #dentropyDaeon would be able to create ontology and folksonomy of every concept a person has come across in their life keeping track of what we have and haven't learned. At the end of the day one's #dentropyDaemon will be able to interact with others #dentropyDaemon allowing us all to more effectively communicate. A person with a #dentropyDaemon will be much more equipped to head in the direction of self actualization. Next time on the #dentropicPortal I will showcase my plan on how to integrate #dentropyDaemon with the future.</p>"},{"location":"a080fea8-e8a2-4de2-97db-413d2993276b/#dentropydaemon-003-practice-dictating-the-vision_1","title":"#dentropyDaemon 003 Practice dictating the vision","text":"<ul> <li>TODO</li> <li>Script</li> <li>Inital work,<ul> <li>Defining a Vision | Paul Mullins Blog</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"a086e10a-046c-4a83-a089-fde2e8d0b9ae/","title":"Redo of  a Healer","text":"<p>wiki.media.type.anime#backlog</p> <ul> <li>This is the ultimate power fantasy.

The skill of going out of your way to make opportunities. To identify what\u2019s missing in my life, and in the world. Finding the actions that I don\u2019t need to take, that no one else will make me take, or do for me, and deciding to take them anyway. Fixing that which is broken. Finding that which is not broken, and deciding to make it better anyway. Exploring and trying new things. Challenging my self-image and growing. Fundamentally escaping the mindset of needing permission, and breaking past the illusion of doing nothing. I think this is one of the most valuable skills anyone can learn, and one I cherish, though I am far from perfect at it. And this experience is a large part of why I value it. Not realising I could make close friends was a failure of agency, an unknown-unknown that cut out a massive amount of potential happiness, without even realising it.</p>"},{"location":"a41f63f6-9eaf-41bb-8e62-e47ffa29cb92/","title":"Discord Guild Specific Report","text":"<ul> <li>Basic Guild Data<ul> <li>How to count the number of bots on a specific discord guild?</li> <li>How to count the number of authors within a specific discord guild?</li> <li>What is the number of channels within a specific discord guild?</li> <li>What are the channels of a particular discord guild?</li> <li>What is the age of the oldest message in each channel of a specific discord guild?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Message Count Queries -

I have been tempted to resolve SQL queries then use python to synthesize the data into the order and format I need for plotly but instead I decided to do as much in SQL as I can. I decided to do as much in SQL as possible because it will later allow me to possibly choose a different programming language from python for my backend, such as JavaScript, Go, Java, or Rust.</p> <p>I also made an interesting discovery today using Plotly to produce multiple lines on a line chart.

The world cannot be run by such a minority of escaped and re-educated minds alone, with all the rest of the heap against them.</p> <p>Before we can talk politics, finance, business, or morals, we must see that we have got the right mental habits and the right foundation of realized facts. There is nothing much to be done with our lives until we have seen to that.</p> <p>We all try to attain the dignity and happiness of magnanimity and escape from the tormenting urgencies of personal desire. In the past that struggle has generally assumed the form of a religious struggle. Religion is the antagonist of self.</p> <p>Just as the normal sexual complex excites and stirs the individual out of his egotism to serve the ends of the race, so the normal religious process takes the individual out of his egotism for the service of the community.</p> <p>This is the third element in the religious relationship, a hope, a promise, an objective which turns the convert not only from himself but from the \u201cworld,\u201d as it is, towards better things. First comes self disregard then service, and then this reconstructive creative urgency.</p> <p>Every religion therefore has had to adopt the physical conceptions, and usually also to assume many of the moral and social values, current at the time of its formation. It could not transcend the philosophical phrases and attitudes that seemed then to supply the natural frame for a faith, nor draw upon anything beyond the store of scientific knowledge of its time. In this lurked the seeds of the ultimate decay and supersession of every successive religion.</p> <p>\u201cI could be perfectly happy leading the life of a Catholic devotee if only I could believe.\u201d But most of the framework of religious explanation upon which that life is sustained is too old-fashioned and too irrelevant to admit of that thoroughness of belief which is necessary for the devotion of intelligent people.</p> <p>It is because we desire a unification of human direction, not simply for the sake of unity, but as a means of release to happiness and power, that it is necessary, at any cost - in delay, in loss of effective force, in strategic or tactical disadvantage - that the light of free, abundant criticism should play upon that direction and upon the movements and unifying organizations leading to the establishment of that unifying direction.</p> <p>There must be food, shelter and leisure for all. The fundamental needs of the animal life must be assured before human life can have free play. Man does not live by bread alone; he eats that he may learn and adventure creatively, but unless he eats he cannot adventure. His life is primarily economic, as a house is primarily a foundation, and economic justice and efficiency must underlie all other activities; but to judge human society and organize political and social activities entirely on economic grounds is to forget the objectives of life's campaign in a preoccupation with supply.</p> <p>There is a clear hope that, later, directed breeding will come within his scope, but that goes beyond his present range of practical achievement, and we need not discuss it further here.</p> <p>\"There is a clear hope that, later, directed breeding will come within his scope, but that goes beyond his present range of practical achievement, and we need not discuss it further here.\"</p> <p>There is no strong instinctive desire for multitudinous offspring, as such, in the feminine make-up.

Nature ensures a pressure of population through passions and instincts that, given sufficient knowledge, intelligence, and freedom on the part of women, can be satisfactorily gratified and  tranquillized, if need be, without the production of numerous children.</p> <p>How to get men to do what has to be done as pleasurably and effectively as possible.</p> <p>Mankind, released from the pressure of population, the waste of warfare and the private monopolization of the sources of wealth, will face the universe with a great and increasing surplus of will and energy.</p> <p>Life which was once routine, endurance, and mischance will become adventure and discovery.

Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.","text":"<p>Discord is a powerful social media tool for managing communities. It's most used feature are Guilds that allow for groups of voice and text channels to be created with powerful RBAC(Rule Based Access Control) tools. It is common for Discord servers to contain 100's of people with 100's of thousands of messages, even millions. As an outsider joining a discord guild community it is difficult to understand what is going on. Many of the people communicating in the text channels know one another quite well therefore they know what one another is interested in, knowledgeable in, and how they like to be interacted with. All these text channels also often have multiple things being talked about all the time making them difficult to follow. I will be exporting discord servers into malleable data formats so the data can be played with to hopefully produce meaningful insights.</p> <p>Just to make the task clear, I am going to develop tooling to generate context for Discord Guilds. The first task is to develop an analytics dashboard that can answer all the queries from Analysis Queries as outlined below. You can also check out Discord Binding to learn more about what these queries mean and do.</p> <p></p> <p>I have developed a dashboard like this previously and learned that it does not produce meaningful insights by itself. The purpose of the queries on the data is to produce insights that can lead to action, not just pretty graphs. I need a framework that can produce intelligence. For example,</p> <ul> <li>We need to be able to separate the Admin announcement accounts from the actual users.</li> <li>We need to be able to know who are doing the work to answer people's questions and who are asking the questions.</li> <li>We need to know who is technical and who is not, plus what kind of technical they are.</li> <li>We need to know how active a user is, for example do they post a question one a month and not even reply to the answer or do they ask a question every other day and give feedback on the answers in the channel.</li> <li>We need to know if people are just talking into a void with people not responding.</li> </ul> <p>All these insights by themselves do not produce intelligence. Once you know who the active people are within a discord community how are you supposed to engage with them? We need to annotate what they want. Know how they are trying to shape the world.</p> <p>I first want to generate PDF reports from Jupyter from the basic insights then post them in the Discord Server highlighting who the important people are and how they are doing.</p> <p>I want to have engaging persona's on all these DAO Discord Communities</p> <p>I observe the usability problems with Discord being because the data layer is one dimensional. You can not annotate on top of content you can only reply or react. I want a tool like Twitter's Community Notes but available to the massed to annotate everyone elses content, with those same powerful RBAC tools.</p> <p>There are many DAO's out there running on Blockchains. These DAO's coordinate using a variety of tools. One tool almost all DAO's have in common is Discord. I want to export all these Discord Server's so I can play with the data.</p> <p>I want to produce reports that will be used to provoke these communities.</p>"},{"location":"a5fc0cc8-0abb-4192-8675-b98e8ee9fad4/#how-is-it-done-today-and-what-are-the-limits-of-current-practice","title":"How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?","text":"<p>One can join a DAO's Discord server and see all the different channels, select each one, and scroll through it.

Today I wish to discuss the Internet's application paradime and why you might want to run apps on your own server. There are almost no applications on ones phone that work without a internet connection. Our photos and notes are backed up and managed on the cloud. Our email and files are stored in the cloud. Social media, meal delivery, ride hailing services, and payment apps require internet for obvious reasons. Our phones are not really running apps but actually function as clients for server applications. The fact that most apps are not just websites frustrates me to no end, but that is a rant for another time. Your apps do not really run on your phone it is just a client for an app actually running in the cloud.</p> <p>Now think about the data you trust to your apps. Very few apps encrypt the data their store for users. The way you know your data is encrypted is if you forget your password you lost your data. Examples of apps that are encrypted are element instant messenger, protonmail and other encrypted email apps, whatsapp, mega file storage, and of course all those password managers. Every other app stores your data on their servers unencrypted in a way that can be looked by anyone with access to the right server. All your photos on iCloud, facebook, flicker, and Google Photos can be looked at by people with the right credentials. All your emails, facebook messages, text messages, and linkedin messages can be seen by people with the right credentials. </p> <p>This brings us to running apps on your own server, self hosting. You can self host your own notes, file sync, photo sharing, and social media applications on your own server. Your might wonder why would you want to run your own apps? I have three reasons for you, privacy, agency, and a digital second brain. Let's start with privacy, as we discussed earlier your apps really run in the cloud therefore if you do not want your data sitting on someone else's server you need to run your own apps on your own server. Many apps today have black box recommendation algorithms as a feature, when your run your own apps you can tune the recommendation algorithm because you control it giving your more agency over your digital persona. Lastly one needs a personal server if they want to create an effective second brain. My digital second brain is spread our across around 300 accounts and apps I have made across my life. I want to have all that data managed in a single place where I can write queries, generate graphs, and perform natural language processing across my entire digital self. I desire to generate an algorithmic reflection of my biases, interests, behaviors, attributes, skills, thoughts, relationships, questions, heuristics in a single system so I can exit my self destructive loops and walk in the direction of self actualization.</p> <p>Any feedback on this rant would be really appreciated.</p>"},{"location":"a9394e6a-74f7-4bdd-8b7f-6487b5ae77c4/#dentropydaemon-002-servers-and-the-internets-application-paradime_1","title":"#dentropyDaemon 002 Servers and the Internet's Application Paradime","text":"<ul> <li>YouTube</li> <li>Odysee</li> <li>Script</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a95871fe-2754-4b3e-bc28-ab156477f16e/","title":"POST wield_persona","text":""},{"location":"a95871fe-2754-4b3e-bc28-ab156477f16e/#input","title":"Input","text":"<ul> <li>data<ul> <li>stringified object<ul> <li>pseudonym</li> <li>unix_time_ms</li> <li>signing_key</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>hash</li> <li>signature_of_hash</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a95871fe-2754-4b3e-bc28-ab156477f16e/#returns","title":"Returns","text":"<ul> <li>Returns STATUS_CODE:<ul> <li>CREATE_PERSONA<ul> <li>PERSONA_ID: </li> <li>BEARER_TOKEN:</li> </ul> </li> <li>Error<ul> <li>That Persona already exists, please claim another one or sign in with the proper public key.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"a95871fe-2754-4b3e-bc28-ab156477f16e/#error-codes","title":"Error Codes","text":"<ul> <li>MISSING_KEYS</li> <li>INCORRECT_HASH_OF_DATA</li> <li>INCORRECT_SIGNATURE_OF_DATA_HASH</li> <li>INCORRECT_SIGNATURE</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a976ba89-4013-4831-ab31-b5d59a7ae971/","title":"Discord Binding User Stories","text":"<p>\"As a consumer of digital media, I want to categorize and sort the media I consume by attaching it to questions, goals, and named entity databases such as wikidata, pubmed, and IMDB\"</p> <p>\"As a individual in search of a online community, I want a system to help me find people with similar values, goals, and interests\"</p> <p>\"As someone who just joined a discord server with hundreds of thousands of messages and thousands of URL's posted, I want help knowing what messages and people I should be paying attention to\"</p> <p>\"As someone looking to invest in crypto projects, I want to know that the project has an engaging community that has valuable discussions\"</p> <p>\"As a community manager of a discord server, I want to know who is adding value to my community and who is not\"</p> <p>\"As a crypto startup founder, I want to know my community manager is doing an effective job cultivating our discord community\"</p> <p>\"As someone that reads through discord messages, I want to be able to tag groups of messages as part of separate topics\"</p>"},{"location":"a984fc49-2539-456b-962b-e801c3379983/","title":"How the Mind Works","text":""},{"location":"a984fc49-2539-456b-962b-e801c3379983/#author","title":"Author","text":"<ul> <li>Steven Pinker</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a984fc49-2539-456b-962b-e801c3379983/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>How the Mind Works by Steven Pinker</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a98788c6-57dc-4a28-8b32-fddaf6e3c1f9/","title":"Pandoc","text":"<ul> <li>Pandoc - Demos</li> <li>makefile - Converting all files in a folder to md using pandoc on Mac - Stack Overflow</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a98788c6-57dc-4a28-8b32-fddaf6e3c1f9/#rename-all-filetypes-in-folder","title":"Rename all filetypes in folder","text":"<pre><code>for file in *html\ndo\n  pandoc $file -o $file.md\ndone\n</code></pre> <pre><code>pandoc --standalone --from markdown -t beamer \\\n  -o MyProjects.Get\\ A\\ Fucking\\ Job.Resumes.pdf \\\n  MyProjects.Get\\ A\\ Fucking\\ Job.Resumes.First\\ Try.md\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"a98788c6-57dc-4a28-8b32-fddaf6e3c1f9/#rename-all-filetypes-in-folder-recursively","title":"Rename all filetypes in folder recursively","text":""},{"location":"a98788c6-57dc-4a28-8b32-fddaf6e3c1f9/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Pandoc - Demos</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a98788c6-57dc-4a28-8b32-fddaf6e3c1f9/#conceptslistdemisexualresume-stuff","title":"Concepts.list.Demisexual.Resume Stuff","text":"<ul> <li>Markdown Resume - Brave Search</li> <li>Editing a CV in markdown with pandoc</li> <li>The Markdown Resume</li> <li>resume.md: a Markdown resume</li> <li>there4/markdown-resume: Generate a responsive CSS3 and HTML5 resume with Markdown, with optional PDF output.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"a99e5b44-35e3-4795-9924-3ca077caae23/","title":"copy key to server","text":"<pre><code>cd ~/.ssh\nscp -r remote* USER@DOMAIN:~/.ssh\nssh \ncd ~/.ssh\neval `ssh-agent -s`\nchmod 700 remote*\nssh-add remotedevelopment\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"a9a837ae-f4c8-4756-87b2-d37f202167dc/","title":"Torrenting Apps","text":"<p>Traefik</p> <p>TORRENTING STUFF</p> <ul> <li>Help setting up rutorrent/deluge with traefik - Traefik / Traefik v2 - Traefik Labs Community Forum</li> <li>[[dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Windows|[windows|[windows|[windows|windows)?

Now the user can open their browser paste the link from the CLI and develop, test, and so forth to their hearts content.</p>"},{"location":"ab1b3bda-a425-49db-80e1-f7cb8f3d6cee/","title":"Fact Tables","text":"<p>Fact table consists of the measurements, metrics or facts of a business process.</p> <p>The Fact table provides the metric of the business process.</p> <ul> <li>Fact Tables:</li> <li>Record business events, like an order, a phone call, a book review</li> <li>Fact tables columns record events recorded in quantifiable metrics like quantity of an item, duration of a call, a book rating</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ab1b3bda-a425-49db-80e1-f7cb8f3d6cee/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Udacity</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ab6d69d4-008f-4263-869e-3e2c27181fda/","title":"Rancher","text":"<pre><code>helm install rancher rancher-alpha/rancher \\\n  --devel \\\n  --namespace cattle-system \\\n  --set hostname=rancher.panda\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"ab9a0e2d-001c-48b3-8eeb-13922d696c9f/","title":"vnc","text":""},{"location":"ab9a0e2d-001c-48b3-8eeb-13922d696c9f/#vnc-server","title":"VNC Server","text":"<ul> <li>Digital Ocean Tutorial</li> <li>Killing a VNC process</li> </ul>"},{"location":"aba2941f-d9fa-4beb-b1b9-8282e5b93647/","title":"Mapping Knowledge Maps (Randy)","text":"<p>Randy%20Engine/Peronas/Randy.md)</p>"},{"location":"abb23e97-d984-42ec-bf1e-2e4f6b0adbfb/","title":"react-force-graph","text":""},{"location":"abb23e97-d984-42ec-bf1e-2e4f6b0adbfb/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>org-mode Roam</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abb23e97-d984-42ec-bf1e-2e4f6b0adbfb/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>vasturiano/react-force-graph: React component for 2D, 3D, VR and AR force directed graphs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abd210c0-7723-46af-80a9-72205bf58e5c/","title":"Activity Watch Upgrade","text":"<ul> <li>Events over time hear map over months, days years visualization</li> <li>Top domains every x period of time</li> <li>Extract youtube view history and put it in a dashboard</li> <li>Replay browser history in actual browser?</li> <li>wiki.ddaemon.design.ddaemon queries</li> </ul>"},{"location":"abd62e8b-845b-41d5-92d3-6ecaa7dca540/","title":"Red Notice","text":"<p>Red Notice - Outside the vault : plotholes</p>"},{"location":"ac17443d-5da2-4a93-9e6a-9eadf53e4bec/","title":"VirtualBox","text":""},{"location":"ac17443d-5da2-4a93-9e6a-9eadf53e4bec/#download-and-install","title":"Download and Install","text":"<p>Get the .deb file from Linux_Downloads \u2013 Oracle VM VirtualBox</p>"},{"location":"ac17443d-5da2-4a93-9e6a-9eadf53e4bec/#fix-screen-size","title":"Fix Screen Size","text":"<p>VM Settings \u00bb Display \u00bb Screen \u00bb Graphics Controller = VBoxVGA. virtualbox.org \u2022 View topic - Guest screen too small</p> <ul> <li>virtualbox - AMD-V is being used by another hypervisor.

During this process I discovered going from json files to sqlite to postgres is not ideal. The reasons for converting to sqlite rather then directly to postgres were the following,</p> <ol> <li>It is easier to load in a sqlite file inside jupyter notebooks than host and connect to a Postgres database</li> <li>One can only load the particular discord guild's they want analytics on into Postgres or any of a list of other Data Engineering Tools</li> <li>It is much easier to share a sqlite file with someone then share a dump from Postgres</li> </ol> <p>The extra step in the procedure was making things much more complicated than they needed to for example here are a list of problems I had,</p> <ol> <li>Conversion of type timestamp from sqlite to Postgres did not work.  The unix time integer in the sqlite database could not be cast directly to type timestamp in postgres without causing an error. The solution I came up with was to have a raw_unix_timestamp column of type Integer, creating additional columns in said table of of name unix_timestamp of type timestamp, then casting the unix_time time stamp from sqlite.</li> <li>Going from JSON tables to native SQL tables was a bad idea. My Python script reformatted all the JSON files from DiscordChatExporter into a series of python dictionaries that easy to work with. I thought it would be simple to just dump those python dictionaries into JSON tables inside my database of choice then perform the transformations in native SQL. The problem is that these transformations now need to be written for SQLite SQL and PostgresSQL because these database have different JSON functions. This also added the complexity where a decision has to be made on which database does the transformation. It would be better to go strait to native SQL rather than using JSON SQL tables.</li> <li>Each discord guild had a separate SQLite database therefore if one wanted to do analysis on two of them at the same time they had to wither write complex connecting code or merge the SQLite databases together. Merging the SQLite databases together is possible though a hassle adding additional complexity. I realized I can just put all the data into postgres and output whatever data I want to SQLite if I really wanted to.</li> <li>I learned about DuckDB as an alternative to SQLite, DuckDB has a built in Postgres connector so I expect creating a portable dataset from Postgres into DubkDB will be much easier than SQLite. DuckDB can even read Parquet files, a file format I should probably be using and I will be coming back to....</li> </ol>"},{"location":"adf51542-a86b-437b-8542-9ef82c41d7a2/#experience-running-etl-pipeline-on-m1-macbook","title":"Experience Running ETL pipeline on M1 Macbook","text":"<p>On my desktop I have about 10,000,000 messages loaded into my Postgres database.

I believe I have finally broken down the problem to something that can be built, used and scale, and I even have a little proof of concept.</p> <p>The root problem as I see it is the premises that go into human conversation. Conversations are pretty close to the axioms of how we coordinate. The axioms of how we coordinate would be the use of statements and questions. One is wither describing the world or asking something of the world. Questions and Statements that make up conversation does not allow an individual or group to navigate the world they require a Persona. People need to be able to wield different personas so they can think through things from different perspectives in order to get to know who they themselves are. This game of getting to know oneself, (I am tho, tho art I), is a multiplayer game, a game of which contains the right medium will naturally emerge into DAO's like Foundry.</p> <p>The Root of a system like Foundry is a system I like to call Quest(ion) Engine. The goal is to have a video game RPG quest engine for real life. The problem is that in real life people do not know what they want therefore a protocol for asking and deconstructing questions could create an emergent system where people start assigning quests to themselves and others.</p> <p>The general idea is to have a product (medium) similar to Twitter and other social media but shape the experience around quests and questions. Users are encouraged to have multiple personas generated by making statements on different sets of questions. This by itself is not revolutionary and doesn't even really constitute a game. Though if we attach tokens, context tokens, with built in RBAC, ICOing the self, and possibly running on uqbar we might have something novel.</p> <p>What if we required a someone's token to interact with them or see their information. Being able to go to someone's facebook page and see what they were posting in highschool should not be free.</p> <p>Here is the the base user story in My Obsidian Vault.</p> <p>TL;DR of the user story is. You don't get to respond to my questions, statements, or posts without minting a token from my faucet and then spending at least one of said token as part of your response. I also have posts that require you spend a token to see what I said. Want to know my favourite movie? Mint my token and spend one to see my answer.</p> <p>Please note, I have implemented a proof of concept of this using signature chains ddaemon / question-engine \u00b7 GitLab. It is demo able but not feature complete.</p> <p>From this fundamental application many things can be built on top of it. I will be adding tag and edge functionality with the goal of creating a Egregore Manager for OSINT purposes. I also want to create knowledge graphs / ontologies / folksonomys. It will also be important for abstractions, context, to be generated by people. Imagine creating a fresh persona and spending your minted tokens on memes in a specific order connected by labelled edges to explain something like gravity, unix, the history of a religion, or why someone is a bad person.</p> <p>I want to build this Quest(ion) Engine application for Holium and make it part of the Real suite. More refinement obviously required, would appreciate feedback.</p> <p>For example with my question-engine implementation I am currently researching which Graph database to create the meme map with, currently SurrealDB seems nice and I want to know if TomeDB can do this.

I means many things, it can be a number, chemical symbol, symbol for electric current, a letter, or in this case a pronoun. Merrian webster defines I as, \"the one who is speaking or writing\". You have your own I and I, Paul Mullins, have my own I. In this blog post I hope to convey my opinion on what I is.</p> <p>Each one of us is a momentary expression of an ever-changing unity with no center. But where do we end and the universe begin? You do not exist without your environment yet within your environment you are still a distinct entity. What makes up that entity such as you and I. One of the most important lessons learned in the 20th century is that brain death equals real death. So if a person is their brain what does that really mean? The human brain in so far as we know is the most complex thing in the universe, capable of beyond super computer levels of computation, and just so happens to also be you. But are you really your brain?</p> <p>When dealing with computers there is a distinction between hardware and software. Hardware is the physical computer, processor, memory, and storage. Software is the code, programs, and state managed by the hardware. The Series Altered Carbon took the concept of hardware and software and applied to humans rather than computers. In Altered Carbon People became DHF(Digital Human Freight) software running on computer chips in the neck of human bodies. These chips, referred to as stack within the series, use the human brain and body as hardware to run consciousness.</p> <p>Another interesting take on what it means to be human is from the Ghost in The Shell series. Within the Ghost in The Shell series a large portion of society has been cyberized getting body parts such as their sections of the brain, or complete arms, legs, heart and other parts cyberized. Within this series the complete digitization of people was not possible. Even though digital consciousness was not possible the series experiments with just how much of a person can be digitized. Within the series one can rewrite a person's memories to make them believe they have a wife and daughter even though they are and have been a bachelor their entire life. Within this series that piece of gray matter we call our brain is unique and manipulable but can't just be copied.</p> <p>But what does this have to do with parasites? I believe consciousness is an emergent phenomenon of parasitic meme's interacting within a human host. Carl Jung's organizing principal is just an emergent phenomenon from the sea of these parasitic memes. I specifically use the term parasitic meme rather than just meme because memes are distinct from their hosts they inhabit though they are very integrated. Memes require human brains in order to survive. Consciousness is how these memes interact with their host in order to stay alive. We have a root set of behaviors built into our bodies and brains but how those behaviors are chained together and executed are managed by memes. Within this sea of cells and memes where is the I? Where does the I differentiate from the rest of human society. I is an individual's memeplex paired with their body and brain.</p> <p>Breaking down the component parts of an individual's memeplex is a fun exercise. For example the word for mother is very similar across many of the worlds languages. There was an entity, likely hominid rather than Homo Sapian, that associated the syllable similar to \"mah\" with mother. The term evolved and changed over time, but the pattern remained. The behavior connecting the sound similar to \"mah\" to mother was a permanent dent in the memeplex of hominids leading directly to you. There is a direct lineage from the first entity to coin the term for mother to you learning the term for mother. The same is true for every word in every language. The mass oh humanity exist to keep the memes of prime movers alive. The mass of humanity acts as a mediocre hard drive preserving the work of the prime movers.</p>"},{"location":"b31360a6-ae1d-45d2-95e1-cd884a27971f/#work-in-progress","title":"Work In Progress","text":"<p>Meme's are either preserved or they decay due to entropy.

With rclone, you can copy files and directories between S3 buckets, as well as synchronize them.</p> <p>To copy objects between S3 buckets using rclone, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Install rclone on your local machine.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure rclone to connect to both S3 buckets. You can do this by running the \"rclone config\" command and following the prompts to set up the S3 remotes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Use the \"rclone copy\" command to copy objects from the source bucket to the destination bucket. For example, to copy all objects from a bucket named \"source-bucket\" to a bucket named \"destination-bucket\", run the following command:</p> <p>rclone copy source-bucket: destination-bucket:</p> <p>Note that the colon after the bucket name is required.</p> <p>You can also use various flags with the \"rclone copy\" command to control the behavior of the copy operation, such as \"--recursive\" to copy all subdirectories, \"--exclude\" to exclude specific files or directories, and \"--dry-run\" to preview the copy operation without actually copying anything.</p> </li> <li> <p>Once the copy operation is complete, you can verify that the objects were copied successfully by checking the destination bucket using the AWS S3 console or the rclone command-line tool.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Note that rclone is a powerful tool with many options and features, so it's important to read the documentation and use it carefully. Also, be aware that copying objects between S3 buckets may incur data transfer charges, depending on the amount of data being copied and the AWS region where the buckets are located.</p>"},{"location":"b3bae7bb-d53b-40cb-8eeb-a0efc703cb75/","title":"Personal Dissonance","text":""},{"location":"b3bae7bb-d53b-40cb-8eeb-a0efc703cb75/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Cognitive Dissonance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b3bae7bb-d53b-40cb-8eeb-a0efc703cb75/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>https://mantracare.org/therapy/what-is/cognitive-dissonance/#The_Three_Types_of_Personal_Dissonance</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b3f6e696-09ef-4b70-88fb-5e82d9f212b5/","title":"Quest Engine (Paul)","text":"<p>Paul Mullins</p> <p>Quest(ion) Engine is supposed to be the first component of the dentropydaemon-wiki/Wiki/Concepts/List/dentropydaemon or the actualisation of the software used in dentropydaemon-wiki/Media/List/Daemon by Daniel Suarez.

Today I want to start exploring the concept of performing human.</p> <p>Performing human, that's pretty cringe concept eh. What does it even mean to \"perform human\". Like we are all human right? We got enough of the same DNA. We all got a couple of our senses working. We can all control at least some part of our body. We all eat, breathe, excrete waste and sleep. But none of those things are really human.</p> <p>Everything I just described is also true for animals. Well at our root we humans are still animals with a couple special characteristics. I mean like, rape still exists in our society for a reason. But it is not really about rape but the desire of sex itself.</p> <p>So what exactly makes Sapians so special, here is a list of things I generated,</p> <ul> <li>The Ability to negotiate with the long future</li> <li>Projects like The Pyramids and Cathedrals took generations of investment to pull off</li> <li>Control the attributes and shape of our environment</li> <li>We regulate the temperature of our homes, light our streets when it is dark, control the flow of water in our homes and cities, and so much more</li> <li>Creation of Art</li> <li>Resonating dents in the universe that encapsulate specific aspects of the human experience as symbols, pretty dope</li> <li>Recreational sex</li> <li>Recreational sex is pretty unique for us in the animal kingdom, I wonder if Bonobos are more closely related to us than Chimpanzees and how public knowledge like that would shape our societies.</li> <li>Language</li> <li>A way to resonate knowledge into the future</li> <li>Agriculture</li> <li>A great example of taking control of our environment</li> <li>Drug abuse</li> <li>The need to escape and forget the feelings ad knowledge of who and what we are. Sometimes even adds some plasticity to the human mind.</li> <li>Socially Scalable Organization</li> <li>Delusions such as god (lower case g), Money, Corporations, and Governments do not exist without humans to live them out but we must treat these things as if they are as real as a chair, river, or rock because it effects our ability to survive.</li> </ul> <p>So what are we supposed to do with this list of what makes sapiens so special. Each and every one of the characteristics is an aspect of the human experience that can be explored.</p> <ul> <li>The Ability to negotiate with the long future</li> <li>We all have our goals and aspirations</li> <li>Control the attributes and shape of our environment</li> <li>We all live somewhere and shaping that environment, physically as well as digitally, can in turn shape us</li> <li>Creation of Art</li> <li>We all have our tastes for art weather it be books, movies, music, or something else</li> <li>Recreational sex</li> <li>Access to sex and happiness are pretty correlated.</li> <li>Language</li> <li>They key to manipulating people</li> <li>Agriculture</li> <li>You are what you eat, eat better feel better</li> <li>Drug abuse</li> <li>We have all made a conscious choice weather or not to participate in the taking of drugs</li> <li>Socially Scalable Organization</li> <li>We all live in a society or are effected by one in some way</li> </ul> <p>So I now have this rough inaccurate map of not the human experience but definitely something human. What am I supposed to do with it? This map does not have a destination on it. It also doesn't bother explaining what experience is. How does one animate a vision of the future and turn that vision into a reality? What does the future feel like and how do we feel our way towards that destination? What does it take to become the protagonist in your own life?</p>"},{"location":"b6791906-cb7c-4d41-83a0-0871922a755d/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.media.list.The Third Chimpanzee: The

I always think of the 1990s narrative was the new economy, and you lied about growth. And then the 2000s narrative was the Great Moderation, and you lied about volatility. And maybe the 2010s one is secular stagnation, where you lie about the real interest rates, because the other two don't work anymore. In sort of a complicated way, these things connect.</p> <p>I find Peter's blerb where he says, \"you lie about the real interest rates\" to be pretty frightening. I follow Peter Schiff where on his podcast, back in the day, he would rant about how some institution here or there changed how they measure inflation to fit some sort of narrative then use the old calculation methods and prove the average american is now much poorer than they were in the past. Another figure Peter Schiff would talk about is how people are just dropping out of the workforce rather than looking for work and how that changed the unemployment rate. The puppet show is that everything is hunky dorry and Peter here is flat out saying people are getting poorer year over year.</p>"},{"location":"b7f300bf-f909-403a-a53c-c91ef38a36ed/#from-file-mediaconsumptionpodcastsnotesorg","title":"From File MediaConsumption.Podcasts.Notes.org","text":"<p>Jre1453</p> <p>Theportal001</p>"},{"location":"b7f300bf-f909-403a-a53c-c91ef38a36ed/#notes-links","title":"Notes Links","text":"<ul> <li>JRE1453</li> <li>LondonReal</li> <li>ThePortal001</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b7f300bf-f909-403a-a53c-c91ef38a36ed/#from-file-mediaconsumptionpodcastsorg","title":"From File MediaConsumption.Podcasts.org","text":"<p>Higharchy</p> <p>List</p>"},{"location":"b7f300bf-f909-403a-a53c-c91ef38a36ed/#missing-links","title":"Missing Links","text":"<ul> <li>Notes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b80ac15e-9c7e-4e11-ac89-1717f19ef3a4/","title":"Sieve","text":""},{"location":"b80ac15e-9c7e-4e11-ac89-1717f19ef3a4/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Sieve Definition &amp; Meaning - Merriam-Webster</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b830a5f1-b10d-4728-941b-b3adfef36ff2/","title":"Wikiwand","text":"<p>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Wikipedia</p>"},{"location":"b83d7b7a-e9ad-4a5e-b9f8-63884a119e6b/","title":"Pinboard","text":"<p>Welcome to Pinboard\u2014Social bookmarking for introverts!</p>"},{"location":"b8a4c886-7f76-4224-8f96-3aed92189082/","title":"Archive Software","text":"<p>Why do I care about Archive Software?</p> <ul> <li>ArchiveBox<ul> <li>I have set this up personally</li> <li>I realize it can not used logged in session to scrape therefore another solution is required to scrape stuff like paid substacks or stuff accessed through a VPN</li> <li>Feed in URL's, get them archived</li> <li>Won't be able to save the current page you are on</li> <li>ArchiveBox Exporter</li> </ul> </li> <li>Anchorage<ul> <li>CLI tool to backup to ArchiveBox or Internet Archive</li> </ul> </li> <li>Save page with single file<ul> <li>I have this installed on my browsers</li> <li>I still can't automate scraping logged in content</li> </ul> </li> <li>DiskerNet<ul> <li>The index does not work nicely</li> <li>Launch chromium and index every page you go to</li> <li>Does not work with brave or firefox</li> <li>I would prefer a chrome extension</li> </ul> </li> <li>Archiveweb.page<ul> <li>Extension that will save pages to browser storage</li> <li>Has desktop app</li> <li>I have no idea what format it is using or how to export</li> </ul> </li> <li>dweb-mirror<ul> <li>Just for mirroring Internet Archive Stuff</li> </ul> </li> <li>irchiver<ul> <li>ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS</li> <li>Takes images of EVERY PAGE YOU GO ON</li> <li>Full text Stearch</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"b8a4c886-7f76-4224-8f96-3aed92189082/#similar-categories","title":"Similar Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Web Scraping</li> </ul>"},{"location":"b8ba3c64-63f3-47bc-bf00-da6a612f7b55/","title":"For Manifesting Destiny v0","text":"<p>These days when I stare in the wiki.concepts.list.Ideological Reflection I do not perceive a constructive interference pattern.

Is it pleasure? Whatever said purpose may be, the purpose of government is surely to promote that individual purpose across the population.</p> <p>Americans today certainly seem to believe that the purpose of life is the pursuit of pleasure. The sincerity of this belief, however, does not make them right. Certainly most societies in history, certainly including most of their ancestors, would disagree.</p> <p>The deep right is\u00a0vitalist: it believes that the purpose of life is vitality, and the purpose of good government is the promotion of general and immeasurable human vitality.</p> <p>Unlike pleasure, which can be \u201cmeasured\u201d statistically (with the model that consumer dollars spent is a rough proxy for pleasure, or so-called \u201cutility\u201d), human vitality is immeasurable in principle. Some aspects of vitality can be measured\u2014physique is an important part of vitality, and there are many excellent metrics of physique\u2014but the problem of vitality as a whole will never submit to any kind of political statistics.</p> <p>Thomas Carlyle called this the\u00a0\u201ccondition of England question\u201d\u2014the problem that the health of a nation, the\u00a0salus populi\u00a0whose preservation and improvement is the purpose of government, cannot be measured. The craze for \u201cgovernment by steam,\u201d for some scientific or mechanical process of decision-making above mere human frailty, was just beginning. Carlyle\u00a0saw right through it:</p> <p>A witty statesman once said, you might prove anything by figures. We have looked into various statistic works, Statistic-Society Reports, Poor-Law Reports, Reports and Pamphlets not a few, with a sedulous eye to this question of the Working Classes and their general condition in England; we grieve to say, with as good as no result whatever.</p> <p>Tables are abstractions, and the object a most concrete one, so difficult to read the essence of. There are innumerable circumstances; and one circumstance left out may be the vital one on which all turned. Statistics is a science which ought to be honourable, the basis of many most important sciences; but it is not to be carried on by steam, this science, any more than others are; a wise head is requisite for carrying it on. Conclusive facts are inseparable from inconclusive except by a head that already understands and knows.</p> <p>One thing the deep right knows is that the condition of a nation is the condition of the humans in it, and that condition (the \u201ccommon good,\u201d if you like) can never be measured in dry numbers\u2014only assessed by human wisdom.</p> <p>A vital human being is operating at their full human potential. Even this potential varies between humans, and between groups of humans. When we look at America today, do we feel that most people we see are living up to their full human potential?</p> <p>You would have to be, like,\u00a0high. The condition of America is\u00a0terrible. Yet if you are not convinced of this, it would be folly for me to try to prove it.</p>"},{"location":"ba705a2b-cd36-41c4-afaa-4668998f17e5/","title":"SQL Database","text":""},{"location":"ba705a2b-cd36-41c4-afaa-4668998f17e5/#reminders","title":"Reminders","text":"<ul> <li>dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Catagories/Database/SQL/SQL Examples</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ba705a2b-cd36-41c4-afaa-4668998f17e5/#list-of-sql-databases","title":"List of SQL Databases","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.software.List.sqlite</li> <li>wiki.software.List.postgres</li> <li>wiki.software.List.mysql</li> <li>wiki.software.List.MariaDB</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ba705a2b-cd36-41c4-afaa-4668998f17e5/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.software.List.postgres#data-types</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ba705a2b-cd36-41c4-afaa-4668998f17e5/#questions","title":"Questions","text":"<ul> <li>What is a parameterized cursor</li> </ul>"},{"location":"ba807965-9c4d-46a0-a163-c4314f5e9b63/","title":"Milgram experiment","text":""},{"location":"ba807965-9c4d-46a0-a163-c4314f5e9b63/#sources","title":"#Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Milgram experiment -

Quests are arrived at by asking questions, Quest(ion) Engine provides the medium for this cognition. The mediums we use to consume data on our computers today don't capture the metadata context behind the decisions people make. Why does someone choose to consume one video over another? How much information does an emoji reaction to a message really have? Are people self censoring because they do not have easy to use fine grained permissions on the information they share? The medium is the message, Quest(ion) Engine hopes to define the message built into the mediums we use to communicate by first creating a system for RBAC(Rule Based Access Control) Socratic dialog.</p> <p>Quest(ion) Engine uses Personas rather than accounts. To \"wield a persona\" you use \"MetaMask\", a interface to the the many masks one can wield and display to the world. To wield a mask you must first \"state that your life has value\" by minting your own token and turning on a faucet so others mint your token so they can interact with you. Every post you or someone makes has to have a token attached to it. Your faucet has settings so you can control how people manipulate your attention for example, a faucet can only work every 20 minutes and give out only 4 tokens each time. In order to interact with someone you must first have some of their token. Once you have their token you can spend it to reveal their answers to questions, reveal questions that are not publicly displayed on their profile, or send them a direct message. When interacting with yourself and others communication is contextualized by meme types such as questions and statements, this medium encourages people to structure their thoughts. This is useful because, when you are now having a conversation you can attach tokens to different parts of the meme graph to signal where people should regulate their attention. This also allows someone create a persona, mint their own token, allocate it throughout the meme graph adding their own edges (links) and stuff. The goal of Question Engine is to provide people not only a tool that they can speak through but a tool they can think through.</p>"},{"location":"cc5cc49d-f554-4f29-b31a-b8789688e6a3/#first-goalpost","title":"First Goalpost","text":"<p>I personally want a way of easily generating and tracking OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loops in a recursive contextualized manner. I want to be able to dump each of my observations into separate memes, then link them together using a graph structure that can display the same data using different visualization techniques. Some of these visualization techniques could be a dag, force graphs, tables, bubble plots, etc. etc. Examples of how to visualize memes graphs can be found Visualization Brainstorming page. </p>"},{"location":"cc5cc49d-f554-4f29-b31a-b8789688e6a3/#proof-of-concept","title":"Proof of Concept","text":"<p>The main reason I am working on Quest(ion) Engine is so I can easily come up with insightful and actionable queries I can run on the datasets I have access to.

Everyone has a subconscious reason for existing but none of us really articulate it. Understanding and articulating one's life purpose is difficult. We all want multiple things and whatever action we make towards one want places the other wants in a different location. Many of us don't even know what we want and need some help from others figuring that out. Through Quest(ion) Engine one can wield a Persona and have deep permissioned dialog with other Personas. Hopefully after enough structured dialog everyone will find meaningful questions specific enough so that they turn into quests.</p>"},{"location":"cc5cc49d-f554-4f29-b31a-b8789688e6a3/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Quest</li> <li>Question</li> <li>Serial Experiments Lain</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cc64a399-1cbe-44ee-ab4a-f36343a593ff/","title":"S3","text":""},{"location":"cc64a399-1cbe-44ee-ab4a-f36343a593ff/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>s3 \u2014 AWS CLI 1.22.76 Command Reference</li> </ul> <pre><code>aws s3 ls \n\naws s3 ls --recursive s3://BUCKET_NAME/\n\naws s3 cp /tmp/foo/ s3://bucket/ --recursive --exclude \"*\" --include \"*.jpg\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cc6c5e5e-cec2-4fca-9417-735223a0b0bd/","title":"ELI5: Science","text":"<p>Science is faith in a fundamental set of assumptions having to do with human experience.

We all have an intuition for what cringe is but here is a nice definition we can overanalyze.

What assumptions am I making about my audience? Does the word normalize apply to the phrase \"meme vectors\" the way I think it does? Am I saying meme vector just to seem smart or does it actually bring novel meaning to this rant? Maybe I am giving too many fucks.</p> <p>So, Theory of Mind. What is this thing? \"Theory of mind refers to the capacity to understand other people by ascribing mental states to them.\" Understand other people.... If I understood another person and understand me wouldn't that make us a single entity? There seems to be an information asymmetry requirement here. For example, is it actually possible to state what you are thinking or are our thoughts so nuanced we are always making an approximation? There is always the capacity to overthink what someone said. Just like society our minds are filled with and endless stream of contradictions. We need to act in the world to sort out these contradictions therefore we are a process that is always approximating.... something. What are we approximating.... I think this is where Plato's forms come in. Hmmm Plato's forms. Those things are not constant are they... they change over time. The forms are a map for the territory of reality and the territory is always changing. We can cringe at the present but we can't cringe at the future.</p> <p>We only study the past to gain power in the present to shape the future. We only suffer because we have selves. Okay audience, I am going to attempt to take out the my \"self\" put it on an a shelf so we can collectively cringe at it. As I said at Complexity Weekend I declare war on information asymmetry. IDK what I am doing yet so let's cringe through the next post posts.Self Actualization.Learning to sail the memes.</p>"},{"location":"cef3066c-8a14-467b-979e-9036068e3653/#examples-some-people-perceive-as-cringe","title":"Examples some people perceive as cringe","text":"<ul> <li>Gamer Girl Manifesto</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/","title":"Blockscout","text":""},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/#error-from-docker-container","title":"Error from docker container","text":"<ul> <li>\"Missing trie node\" &amp; \"required historical state unavailable\" in logs \u00b7 Issue #2219 \u00b7 blockscout/blockscout</li> <li>Missing trie node error from 0x00... account tx's [geth/clique] \u00b7 Issue #1593 \u00b7 blockscout/blockscout</li> <li>Browser is known after startup in the same error \u00b7 Issue #4176 \u00b7 blockscout/blockscout</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/#docker","title":"docker","text":"<p>Unable to build Dockerfile \u00b7 Issue #4023 \u00b7 blockscout/blockscout \u00b7 GitHub</p> <pre><code>docker build --file docker/Dockerfile .\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Repos</li> <li>GitHub - ulamlabs/blockscout-docker: Blockscout Docker image<ul> <li>ulamlabs's Profile | Docker Hub</li> </ul> </li> <li>GitHub - xJonathanLEI/docker-blockscout: GitHub Actions workflow for building Blockscout Docker images</li> <li>GitHub - SurfingNerd/blockscout-docker-compose: A docker-compose ready setup for blockscout to spin up a new instance fast.</li> <li></li> </ul>"},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/#blockscout-requirements","title":"BlockScout Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>erlang</li> <li>Install Latest Erlang on Ubuntu 20.04 | 18.04 LTS | ComputingForGeeks</li> <li><code>wget -O- https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/erlang_solutions.asc | sudo apt-key add -   echo \"deb https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu focal contrib\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rabbitmq.list   sudo apt update   sudo apt install erlang   erl</code></li> <li>Rust</li> <li>Install Rust - Rust Programming Language</li> <li><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh</code></li> </ul> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install -y elixir postgresql automake libtool  inotify-tools make g++ cargo libgmp3-dev\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/#scratchpad","title":"Scratchpad","text":"<pre><code>export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/blockscout\nexport ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_VARIANT=ganache\nexport ETHEREUM_JSONRPC_HTTP_URL=http://localhost:8545\nexport COIN=SWMIO\nmake start\n\nmix do deps.get, local.rebar --force, deps.compile, compile\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cefe77de-ab0b-47e6-9629-86fae2ff36f0/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>Mix%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#2447%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub%5D(https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/2447%7C(Mix)%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#2447%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub%5D(https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/2447%7C(Mix)%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#2447%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub) Mix%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#604%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub%5D(https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/604%7C(Mix)%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#604%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub%5D(https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout/issues/604%7C(Mix)%20Could%20not%20compile%20dependency%20:keccakf1600%20%C2%B7%20Issue%20#604%20%C2%B7%20blockscout/blockscout%20%C2%B7%20GitHub)</p> <pre><code>rm -rf _build/ deps/\ngit checkout v3.3.2-beta\nmix do deps.get, local.rebar --force, deps.compile, compile\n</code></pre> <pre><code>cd deps\ngit clone https://github.com/ayrat555/ex_keccak\nrm -rf keccakf1600\nmv ex_keccak keccakf1600\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"cf293569-0322-486e-9649-6e1b4b4ce9fa/","title":"Audiobooks Software","text":"<ul> <li>audioserve</li> <li>Cozy</li> <li>Voice Audiobook Player</li> <li>BadaBoomBooks</li> <li>m4b-tool</li> <li>beets-audible</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cf293569-0322-486e-9649-6e1b4b4ce9fa/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>audio - Audiobook player for Linux - Software Recommendations Stack Exchange</li> <li>audiobooks \u00b7 GitHub Topics</li> <li>seanap/Plex-Audiobook-Guide: A walkthrough for optimal Audiobook experience using Plex</li> </ul>"},{"location":"cf293569-0322-486e-9649-6e1b4b4ce9fa/#todo","title":"TODO","text":"<ul> <li>audio - Audiobook player for Linux - Software Recommendations Stack Exchange</li> <li>izderadicka/audioserve: Simple personal server to serve audiofiles files from folders.

However, the word essay also means attempt or try. An essay is, therefore, a short piece written by someone attempting to explore a topic or answer a question.</p> <p>Why bother writing an essay? Most of the time, students write essays only because they are required to do so by a classroom instructor. Thus, students come to believe that essays are important primarily to demonstrate their knowledge to a teacher or professor. This is simply, and dangerously, wrong (even though such writing for demonstration may be practically necessary).</p> <p>The primary reason to write an essay is so that the writer can formulate and organize an informed, coherent and sophisticated set of ideas about something important.</p> <p>Why is it important to bother with developing sophisticated ideas, in turn? It\u2019s because there is no difference between doing so and thinking, for starters. It is important to think because action based on thinking is likely to be far less painful and more productive than action based upon ignorance. So, if you want to have a life characterized by competence, productivity, security, originality and engagement rather than one that is nasty, brutish and short, you need to think carefully about important issues. There is no better way to do so than to write. This is because writing extends your memory, facilitates editing and clarifies your thinking.</p> <p>You can write down more than you can easily remember, so that your capacity to consider a number of ideas at the same time is broadened. Furthermore, once those ideas are written down, you can move them around and change them, word by word, sentence by sentence, and paragraph by paragraph. You can also reject ideas that appear substandard, after you consider them more carefully. If you reject substandard ideas, then all that you will have left will be good ideas. You can keep those, and use them. Then you will have good, original ideas at your fingertips, and you will be able to organize and communicate them.</p> <p>Consider your success over the course of a lifetime. Here is something to think about: the person who can formulate and communicate the best argument almost always wins. If you want a job, you have to make a case for yourself. If you want a raise, you have to convince someone that you deserve it. If you are trying to convince someone of the validity of your idea, you have to debate its merits successfully, particularly if there are others with other competing ideas.</p> <p>If you sharpen your capacity to think and to communicate as a consequence of writing, you are better armed. The pen is mightier than the sword, as the saying goes. This is no cheap clich\u00e9. Ideas change the world, particularly when they are written. The Romans built buildings, and the Romans and the buildings are both gone. The Jews wrote a book, and they are still here, and so is the book. So it turns out that words may well last longer than stone, and have more impact than whole empires.</p> <p>If you learn to write and to edit, you will also be able to tell the difference between good ideas, intelligently presented, and bad ideas put forth by murky and unskilled thinkers. That means that you will be able to separate the wheat from the chaff (look it up). Then you can be properly influenced by profound and solid ideas instead of falling prey to foolish fads and whims and ideologies, which can range in their danger from trivial to mortal.</p> <p>Those who can think and communicate are simply more powerful than those who cannot, and powerful in the good way, the way that means \u201cable to do a wide range of things competently and efficiently.\u201d Furthermore, the further up the ladder of competence you climb, with your well-formulated thoughts, the more important thinking and communicating become. At the very top of the most complex hierarchies (law, medicine, academia, business, theology, politics) nothing is more necessary and valuable. If you can think and communicate, you can also defend yourself, and your friends and family, when that becomes necessary, and it will become necessary at various points in your life.</p> <p>Finally, it is useful to note that your mind is organized verbally, at the highest and most abstract levels. Thus, if you learn to think, through writing, then you will develop a well-organized, efficient mind \u2013 and one that is well-founded and certain. This also means that you will be healthier, mentally and physically, as lack of clarity and ignorance means unnecessary stress. Unnecessary stress makes your body react more to what could otherwise be treated as trivial affairs. This makes for excess energy expenditure, and more rapid aging (along with all the negative health-related consequences of aging).</p> <p>So, unless you want to stay an ignorant, unhealthy lightweight, learn to write (and to think and communicate). Otherwise those who can will ride roughshod over you and push you out of the way. Your life will be harder, at the bottom of the dominance hierarchies that you will inevitably inhabit, and you will get old fast.</p> <p>Don\u2019t ever underestimate the power of words. Without them, we would still be living in trees. So when you are writing an essay, you are harnessing the full might of culture to your life. That is why you write an essay (even if it has been assigned). Forget that, and you are doing something stupid, trivial and dull. Remember it, and you are conquering the unknown.</p> <p>A note on use of time Your brain functions better in the morning. Get up. Eat something. You are much smarter and more resilient after you have slept properly and eaten. There is plenty of solid research demonstrating this. Coffee alone is counter-productive. Have some protein and some fat. Make a smoothie with fruit and real yogurt. Go out and buy a cheap breakfast, if necessary. Eat by whatever means necessary. Prepare to spend between 90 minutes and three hours writing. However, even 15 minutes can be useful, particularly if you do it every day.</p> <p>Do not wait for a big chunk of free time to start. You will never get big chunks of free time ever in your life, so don\u2019t make your success dependent on their existence. The most effective writers write every day, at least a bit.</p> <p>Realize that when you first sit down to write, your mind will rebel. It is full of other ideas, all of which will fight to dominate. You could be looking at Facebook, or Youtube, or watching or reading online porn, or cleaning the dust bunnies from under your bed, or rearranging your obsolete CD collection, or texting an old flame, or reading a book for another course, or getting the groceries you need, or doing the laundry, or having a nap, or going for a walk (because you need the exercise), or phoning a friend or a parent \u2013 the list is endless. Each part of your mind that is concerned with such things will make its wants known, and attempt to distract you. Such pesky demons can be squelched, however, with patience. If you refuse to be tempted for fifteen minutes (25 on a really bad day) you will find that the clamor in your mind will settle down and you will be able to concentrate on writing. If you do this day after day, you will find that the power of such temptations do not reduce, but the duration of their attempts to distract you will decrease. You will also find that even on a day where concentration is very difficult, you will still be able to do some productive writing if you stick it out.</p> <p>Don\u2019t kid yourself into thinking you will write for six hours, either. Three is a maximum, especially if you want to sustain it day after day. Don\u2019t wait too late to start your writing, so you don\u2019t have to cram insanely, but give yourself a break after a good period of sustained concentration. Three productive hours are way better than ten hours of self-deceptive non-productivity, even in the library.</p> <p>Words, sentences, paragraphs and more An essay, like any piece of writing, exists at multiple levels of resolution, simultaneously. First is the selection of the word. Second is the crafting of the sentence. Each word should be precisely the right word, in the right location in each sentence. The sentence itself should present a thought, part of the idea expressed in the paragraph, in a grammatically correct manner. Each sentence should be properly arranged and sequenced inside a paragraph, the third level of resolution. As a rule of thumb, a paragraph should be made up of at least 10 sentences or 100 words. This might be regarded as a stupid rule, because it is arbitrary. However, you should let it guide you, until you know better. You have very little right to break the rules, until you have mastered them.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a little story to illustrate that idea, taken in part from a document called the Codex Bezae.</p> <p>Christ is walking down the road on the Sabbath, when good Jews of that time were not supposed to work. In the ditch, he sees a shepherd, trying to rescue a sheep from a hole that it has fallen into. It is very hot and, clearly, the sheep will not be in very good shape if it spends a whole day in the desert sun. On the other hand, it is the Sabbath. Christ looks at the shepherd and says, \u201cMan, if indeed thou knowest what thou doest, thou art blessed: but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and a transgressor of the law.\u201d Then he walks on down the road.</p> <p>The point is this: There is a rest day for a reason. Otherwise people would work all the time. Then they would be chronically unhappy and exhausted. They would compete each other to death. So if it\u2019s time for everybody to rest, then rest, and don\u2019t be breaking the rule. However, it is also not good to let a sheep die in the hot sun, when a few minutes of labor might save it. So, if you are respectful of the rule, and conscious of its importance, and realize that it serves as a bulwark against the chaos of the unknown, and you still decide to break it, carefully, because the particularities of the circumstances demand it \u2013 well, then, more power to you. If you are just a careless, ignorant, antisocial narcissist instead, however, then look out. You break a rule at your peril, whether you know it or not.</p> <p>Rules are there for a reason. You are only allowed to break them if you are a master. If you\u2019re not a master, don\u2019t confuse your ignorance with creativity or style. Writing that follows the rules is easier for readers, because they know roughly what to expect. So rules are conventions. Like all conventions, they are sometimes sub-optimal. But not very often. So, to begin with, use the conventions. For example, aim to make your paragraphs about 10 sentences or 100 words long.</p> <p>A paragraph should present a single idea, using multiple sentences. If you can\u2019t think up 100 words to say about your idea, it\u2019s probably not a very good idea, or you need to think more about it. If your paragraph is rambling on for 300 words, or more, it\u2019s possible that it has more than one idea in it, and should be broken up.</p> <p>All of the paragraphs have to be arranged in a logical progression, from the beginning of the essay to the end. This is the fourth level of resolution. Perhaps the most important step in writing an essay is getting the paragraphs in proper order. Each of them is a stepping stone to your essay\u2019s final destination.</p> <p>The fifth level of resolution is the essay, as a whole. Every element of an essay can be correct, each word, sentence, and paragraph \u2013 even the paragraph order \u2013 and the essay can still fail, because it is just not interesting or important. It is very hard for competent but uninspired writers to understand this kind of failure, because a critic cannot merely point it out. There is no answer to their question, \u201cexactly where did I make a mistake?\u201d Such an essay is just not good. An essay without originality or creativity might fall into this category. Sometimes a creative person, who is not technically proficient as a writer, can make the opposite mistake: their word choice is poor, their sentences badly constructed and poorly organized within their paragraphs, their paragraphs in no intelligible relationship to one another \u2013 and yet the essay as a whole can succeed, because there are valuable thoughts trapped within it, wishing desperately to find expression.</p> <p>Additional levels You might think that there could not possibly be anything more to an essay than these five levels of resolution or analysis, but you would be wrong. This is something that was first noticed, perhaps, by those otherwise entirely reprehensible and destructive scholars known as post-modernists. An essay necessarily exists within a context of interpretation, made up of the reader (level six), and the culture that the reader is embedded in (level seven), which is made up in part of the assumptions that he or she will bring to the essay. Levels six and seven have deep roots in biology and culture. You might think, \u201cWhy do I need to know this?\u201d but if you don\u2019t you are not considering your audience, and that\u2019s a mistake. Part of the purpose of the essay is to set your mind straight, but the other part, equally important, is to communicate with an audience.</p> <p>For the essay to succeed, brilliantly, it has to work at all of these levels of resolution simultaneously. That is very difficult, but it is in that difficulty that the value of the act of writing exists.</p> <p>Considerations of Aesthetics and Fascination This is not all that has to be properly managed when you write an essay. You should also strive for brevity, which is concise and efficient expression, as well as beauty, which is the melodic or poetic aspect of your language (at all the requisite levels of analysis). Finally, you should not be bored, or boring. If you are bored while writing, then, most importantly, you are doing it wrong, and you will also bore your reader. Think of it this way: you get bored for a reason, and sometimes for a good reason. You may be bored while writing your essay because you are actually lying to yourself in a very deep way about what you are doing and why you are doing it. Your mind, independent of your ego, cannot be hoodwinked into attending to something that you think is uninteresting or useless. It will automatically regard such a thing as unworthy of attention, and make you bored by it.</p> <p>If you are bored by your essay, you have either chosen the wrong topic (one which makes no difference to you and, in all likelihood, to anyone else) or you are approaching a good topic in a substandard manner. Perhaps you are resentful about having to write the essay, or afraid of its reception, or lazy, or ignorant, or unduly and arrogantly skeptical, or something of the kind.</p> <p>You have to place yourself in the correct state of mind to write properly. That state of mind is partly aesthetic. You have to be trying to produce something of worth, beauty and elegance. If you think that is ridiculous, then you are far too stupid at the moment to write properly. You need to meditate long and hard on why you would dare presume that worth, beauty and elegance are unworthy of your pursuit. Do you plan to settle for ugly and uncouth? Do you want to destroy, instead of build?</p> <p>You must choose a topic that is important to you. This should be formulated as a question that you want to answer. This is arguably the hardest part of writing an essay: choosing the proper question. Perhaps your instructor has provided you with a list of topics, and you think you are off the hook as a consequence. You\u2019re not. You still have to determine how to write about one of those topics in a manner that is compelling to you. It\u2019s a moral, spiritual endeavour.</p> <p>If you properly identify something of interest to you, then you have put yourself in alignment with the deeper levels of your psyche, your spirit. If these deeper levels do not want or need an answer to the question you have posed, you will not possibly be interested in it. So the fact of your interest is evidence of the importance of the topic. You, or some part of you, needs the answer \u2013 and such needs can be deep enough so that life itself can depend upon them. Someone desperate, for example, might find the question \u201cwhy live?\u201d of extreme interest, and absolutely require an answer that makes life\u2019s suffering worth bearing. It is not necessary to ensure that every question you try or essay to answer be of that level of importance, but you should not waste your time with ideas that do not grip you.</p> <p>So, the proper attitude is interested and aesthetically sensitive.</p> <p>Having said all that, here is something to remember: finished beats perfect. Most people fail a class or an assignment or a work project not because they write badly, and get D\u2019s or F\u2019s, but because they don\u2019t write at all, and get zeroes. Zeroes are very bad. They are the black holes of numbers. Zeroes make you fail. Zeroes ruin your life. Essays handed in, no matter how badly written, can usually get you at least a C. So don\u2019t be a completely self-destructive idiot. Hand something in, regardless of how pathetic you think it is (and no matter how accurate you are in that opinion).</p>"},{"location":"d631fbd2-3680-49fb-8bf0-b009d6c43210/","title":"nvm","text":"<pre><code>wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash\necho `export NVM_DIR=\"$([ -z \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}\" ] &amp;&amp; printf %s \"${HOME}/.nvm\" || printf %s \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm\")\"` &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\necho `[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] &amp;&amp; \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm` &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\nnvm install node\nnvm use node\n\n# .zshrc\necho `export NVM_DIR=\"$([ -z \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}\" ] &amp;&amp; printf %s \"${HOME}/.nvm\" || printf %s \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm\")\"` &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\necho `[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] &amp;&amp; \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm` &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc\nsource ~/.zshrc\n\n# Raw Stuff\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$([ -z \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}\" ] &amp;&amp; printf %s \"${HOME}/.nvm\" || printf %s \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm\")\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] &amp;&amp; \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\n\n</code></pre> <p>GitHub - nvm-sh/nvm: Node Version Manager - POSIX-compliant bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions</p> <pre><code>    nvm install --lts\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"d6321a61-0b6f-49f7-b537-0476879dad25/","title":"Specific Aims - DDaemon","text":""},{"location":"d6321a61-0b6f-49f7-b537-0476879dad25/#specific-aims","title":"Specific Aims","text":"<p>Many computer applications people use today run in the cloud where user data and metadata is put in a walled garden locking people into said application. </p> <p>Web browsers are clients that use applications running on a computer in the cloud.</p> <p>title: DentropyDaemon Specific Aims description:  published: true date: 2021-01-16T01:18:07.862Z tags:  editor: undefined dateCreated: 2021-01-16T01:18:05.911Z</p>"},{"location":"d6321a61-0b6f-49f7-b537-0476879dad25/#specific-aims_1","title":"Specific Aims","text":"<p>Many computer applications people use today run in the cloud where user data and metadata is put in a walled garden locking people into said application. </p> <p>Web browsers are clients that use applications running on a computer in the cloud.</p>"},{"location":"d68d4ede-ee87-4422-b04f-eb77b16bdda9/","title":"Thinking Through Creator Reputation Token","text":"<p>Date: November 2022</p> <p>I am still throwing ideas at the wall to see what sticks, I hope this piece is more precise than my past one above.</p>"},{"location":"d68d4ede-ee87-4422-b04f-eb77b16bdda9/#follow-up-on-next-steps","title":"Follow up on Next Steps","text":"<p>I was developing some system diagrams for an Appointed Board and just ended up creating a Gnosis Safe and practiced its different user flows on a testnet.

Reddit, like facebook, tumblr, and myspace used to be interesting places before they experienced ethernal september. Can we create a feature parity social network to big tech, and if eternal september ever occours have regulations in place to deal with the externalities? Well, let me walk you through something I would be interested in building to solve that problem.</p> <p>What if all planets were attached to an Ethereum Address, or NFT's such as ENS Names. It would be very interesting to see urbit names showing up in ENS the same way they show up all over twitter. I am aware that many planets have migrated to L2 making urbit independent of Ethereum, but I think a bridge back to EVM blockchains for urbit users to use dapps would be valuable. In order to implement this one planet one vote system, we would require a bridge back to the internet of blockchains.</p> <p>Bridges require nodes operating on both networks, or as I like to think of them, certificate authorities. I specifically used the phrase \"federated\" cryptographic reddit for a reason. How are we supposed to know what planets map to what EVM addresses, and verify one planet does not have more than one address? Well that sounds like a double spend problem to me, the very thing blockchain was invented to prevent. Every Creator DAO can be bootstrapped, independently, by a set of authorities that can be managed as a dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Gnosis Safe 1 on a blockchain of their choosing. A quorum of Gnosis Safe addresses would be required to sign for every user, planet, added to the network. Then the user themselves signs the signed signatures, including the block signature of the last user added. The \"blockchain\" of users, planets, would actually be maintained on the urbit network, not a public blockchain. Urbit Planet's can also use different EVM addresses for different DAO's. Also, a Gnosis Safe is not technically required for a system like this but would simply be recommended. Also, users would not require doing any on chain transaction unless users were required to hold some tokens or a NFT in order to join.</p> <p>What if every post on reddit formed its own chain of cryptographic signatures for every up vote, down vote, comment, tag, and token gifted (reddit gold) performed on said post. All the \"Adding Context\" mentioned earlier is done like this. The sharing of these signature chains all done through the urbit network. These signature chains can be redeemed for reputation token on chain via an oracle like reality.eth and be integrated with something like snapshot or Gnosis Safe with the Voting Module (More on Oracle's Later). The ability to upvote and down vote content can optionally require a specific kind of NFT or  require token holder threshold be met. The minting of the token into reputation can also have a tax on it that would give the creator DAO a treasury. You want power within this DAO, you must sacrifice some of yours. User Stories Required. Now let's talk a bit about implementation.</p> <p>Now, how would I actually go about developing this. I understand that urbit currently has storage issues and a Creator DAO like the one I have described would require some sort of CDN. Just spit balling here, I am not attached to this technology, but I think that Ceramic.Network would great as a storage backend for a project like this. The \"user planet blockchain\" data structure would fit perfectly into their streams API and planets themselves could eventually fit into their DID standard. Also, ceramic.network could hold the actual images, videos, and other media files and metadata required to get something like this working, further investigation required. In the very least, Urbit can natively manage the identity planet chain and posts but ceramic might work nicely as a CDN, as compared to torrents mentioned earlier. In short, if I were developing this without urbit I would use Ceramic.</p> <p>In terms of a proof of concept, I have a proposal for a DAO extension that does not seem to exist. I propose developing a DAO extension to allow DAO's to issue a token mapped to a Token Bonding Curve. Token Bonding Curves work by binding the value of a token to a stable asset. Let's do a though experiment to illistrate this using PCoin. A linear bonding curve would have the first buyer buy a token for 1 DAI and the second user would buy a token for 2 DAI with the third user buying a token for 3 DAI. Now at this point the person who bought PCoin for 1 DAI can sell the token for 3DAI. From here, you can probably imagine all the calculus involved. You can also swap out the linear curve for a logarithmic or parabolic etc... etc... In reality you would likely use a portion of a logarithmic curve. With token bonding curves, people can cash out of communities and gate keep. Curves can also be swapped in and out. If a communities token isn't useful the holder in incentivized not to hold it. If the community's token is useful, more people will be incentivized to buy it. You can also have a second curve shave off a tax of people buying and selling, building a treasury. As for what this looks like in reality as a product, I still need to write some user stories. I am also aware I mentioned turning Merkel proof's of reactions of a post into a token, I think these systems can work together, I just don't know how yet.</p> <p>Another useful feature of developing a system like this is that it evolves nicely in an Urbit Oracle Network. This application would result in collections of planets bootstrapping Gnosis Safe's on different chains. The wallets, or proxy keys, behind these Gnosis Safe's would be signing stuff all the time. The Merkel proofs of community engagement being minted into a token requires oracles. We can even use the same oracle contracts and networks, but have the data for said event's available only on urbit. I could imagine an oracle network like this become useful to something more than the application I am describing here. Though, again, needs user stories.</p>"},{"location":"d68d4ede-ee87-4422-b04f-eb77b16bdda9/#next-steps","title":"Next Steps","text":"<ul> <li>USER STORIES, Integrate this with the Raindrop.io / pinboard idea</li> <li>Research reference DAO frameworks such as Substrate Pallets and write Rough Spec for Token Bonding Curve Module</li> <li>Research DAO Extensions for Gnosis Safe, Snapshot, and Aragon</li> <li>Apply Design until I arrive at POC</li> </ul>"},{"location":"d68d4ede-ee87-4422-b04f-eb77b16bdda9/#brainstorming","title":"Brainstorming","text":"<p>Each Subreddit, NEEDS A CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY</p> <p>The Stack Overflow Problem where the old posts get all the attention.</p> <p>Urbit is technically a clean slate operating system implimentation for the 21st centary but it was still booted on Ethereum rather than using something like a good old fashioned PGP Registry.</p> <p>Never underestimate a small group of highly commited people who think they can change the world.</p> <p>Generate a NFT with the block number you are in the DAO.

G. Wells asked What are we to do with our lives? in \"The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution\". Wells believed that the existing social, political, and economic structures of his time were inadequate and unable to address the pressing challenges facing humanity. The book proposed the idea of an \"open conspiracy\" or a loosely organized movement of like-minded individuals working towards the establishment of a world order based on principles of \"science\", \"reason\", and \"social progress\".</p> <p>The ideas that H.G.Wells articulated almost 100 years ago are flourishing within the world of today. With the WEF, financial centralisation, power of multi national corporations, and centralised control over the means of communication we are heading towards Wells' vision of a \"global community\" managed by \"Science\", \"reason\", and \"social progress\". What society has failed to integrate since the publishing of \"The Open Conspiracy\" is the reactions to this \"global community\" as articulated in \"Brave New World\",  \"The Rediscovery of Man\", \"The Matrix\" and oh so many more.</p> <p>The world we live in is becoming all one big massively correlated experiment that has already grown to a level of complexity where we do not understand what is going on anymore. The experiment that is going on should be allowed to run but it should not create a system of massive inter dependence that can lead to a cascade of failing systems leading to a future dystopia that no human wants to live in.</p> <p>What values Humanity brings with it into its future is a very complex problem deserving of multiple solutions. There are many ways to play the human instrument, some resonate, some don't, there has to be a way for us all to live lives worth living.</p>"},{"location":"dc0faa57-ac29-446f-b1a7-0c38ee771633/#where-we-are-now","title":"Where We Are Now","text":"<p>Failed Networked and Crypto Dreams</p> <p>Back in the early 90's the wannabe technocrats on usenet expected direct democracy to scale using TCP/IP.

We are seeing more and more headlines that belong in an Ayn Rand novel. We are losing our perspective of history faster and faster. People are lost and don't know what to value anymore. Societies mental health is declining for many reasons but in my opinion the number one reason is the increacing complexity of the world without the heuristics to meaningfully navigate it.</p> <p>At the beginning of the 20th centary we had three stories humanity told itself, the fascist story, the communist story, and the liberal story. The Second World War knocked out the fascist story, and from the late 1940s to the late 1980s the world became a battleground between just two stories: communism and liberalism. Then the communist story collapsed, and the liberal story remained the dominant guide to the human past and the indispensable manual for the future of the world\u2014or so it seemed to the global elite. However, since the global financial crisis of 2008 people all over the world have become increasingly disillusioned with the liberal story. Walls and firewalls are back in vogue. Resistance to immigration and to trade agreements is mounting. Ostensibly democratic governments undermine the independence of the judiciary system, restrict the freedom of the press, and portray any opposition as treason. Strongmen in countries such as Turkey and Russia experiment with new types of illiberal democracies and outright dictatorships. Today, few would confidently declare that the Chinese Communist Party is on the wrong side of history.</p> <p>We are losing our ability to productively communicate</p> <p>When social media companies set up algorithms to optimize for attention spent on each of their walled gardens they did not foresee that it would would lead to political division and radicalisation. The time to start worrying about AI generated content on the internet is last year as we already AI content farms generating pretty watchable content on Youtube and that doesn't even get into Fake Internet Theory. Attention spans are degrading, people are now likely spending more time on TikTok than youtube or netflix.</p> <p>People are staring into their electronic devices being programmed by them because they can not critically engage with the software as it is designed today.</p> <p>%% - Attempts     - Are we living in a world we want to live in? If not, what world do we want to live in? Once we have articulated the world we want to live, how do we navigate there. Navigating there requires leverage, what types of leverage do we have available to us, who has it, and how do we get them to wield it while resonating with our vision of the future. - Purpose     - Why does this section exist?         - To answer questions         - To describe the current situation     - What questions does this section answer?         - Describe the world in a way that appears undesirable         - Describe the problems we creates for ourselves         - Describe the dream of crypto and how it was corrupted.     - Can this section be removed without effecting the structure of the whole piece? - Prompts     - What organising principal are people implicitly following?     - We have arrived in a world where the youth of today view state mandated happiness as a utopia not a dystopia.     - People are increasingly communicating through algorithms and not with actual people.     - The closer we approach the \"Technological Singularity\" the less capable our institutions and the individuals that make them up are capable of making effective decisions.     - How should human behavior be regulated? %%</p>"},{"location":"dc0faa57-ac29-446f-b1a7-0c38ee771633/#a-game-to-design-the-human-experience","title":"A Game to Design The Human Experience","text":"<p>Digital worlds may soon become more compelling than the reality we actually live in.

we don't know if they are in the database or not</li> <li>There are a fuck tone of links</li> <li>We do not care about optimization until later</li> <li>Alright but can't we use the full_url as the primary key</li> <li>Ohhhhhhh that needs to be written down somewhere<ul> <li>Well we can do that, what would we need to change</li> <li>We would need to change the insert and stuff</li> <li>This is just far more efficient</li> <li>Can we do join's on strings</li> <li>Why not</li> <li>It is easier than doing a select check for everything</li> <li>YES FAR EASIER</li> <li>Alright let's do it</li> </ul> </li> <li>Done, it's now doing the recursive scraping</li> <li>Wonderful what's next</li> <li>Next is to do the network stuff</li> <li>Oh yes, wireguard or openvpn</li> <li>It would be cool to do wireguard</li> <li>Let's find a tutorial</li> <li>Wait this is a separate tutorial</li> <li>Yes, yes it is</li> <li>So IDK if I am scraping correctly, I am extracting all parts of the URL, I think is is compartamentalized well enough</li> <li>I should be reading right now</li> </ul> </li> <li>2023-04-06<ul> <li>Well I just lost all those logs RIP</li> <li>Gotta remember to git stash</li> <li>So where were we</li> <li>We have the scrape URL file finished</li> <li>Yes what comes after that?</li> <li>Now we need to actually scrape it, then we need to have a session where we delete the scraped, add the log</li> <li>Next we need to scrape, upload contents, then delete scrape, add log</li> <li>That seems doable</li> <li>So how are we supposed to do the jobs?</li> <li>I mean extract the URL's</li> <li>Is this going to be a separate job</li> <li>Yes it is obviously a separate job</li> <li>So how does the system know when to do it?</li> <li>There are the we have the job logs, we have the scraping queue</li> <li>Are we renaming it job queue?</li> <li>Ya, then we can add another type of job</li> <li>This is where callback functions come in doesn't it</li> <li>YES</li> <li>We can just store it in the HTML contents</li> <li>No we store it in the logs, cause the contents can be object storage</li> <li>Do we want to practice JSON in sqlalchemy</li> <li>No we should do that in the tutorial</li> <li>Alright so how do we do this</li> <li>We append the logs with a links_extracted boolean</li> <li>Sure why the fuck not</li> <li>And we do string</li> <li>Do we want to jump to jobs server now?</li> <li>No we want to know how to do this single threaded</li> <li>Then we can do jobs and stuff</li> <li>So the next thing to do would be what exactltly?</li> <li>Alright so what would the next thing be?</li> <li>We read through the URLs and decide which ones need to be scraped</li> <li>Are we going to have to process the domains as well</li> <li>Yes, yes we will</li> <li>Then what do we do?</li> <li>We read all the URLs and path that have not been scraped and put them in queue after every URL we scrape until we have a lot of like 100</li> <li>Can we do that right now</li> <li>Probably</li> <li>So what was the plan?</li> <li>Subdomain parsing</li> <li>Wait do we really need that, we can just do the right SQL queries like distinct with a %.fandom.com, ya that is over engineering, trust the library developers</li> <li>So then we just need a function that can geed new urls into the queue and scrape again until a specific number of logs exist</li> <li>We still need to check http error and log it</li> <li>Alright than that's basically it then right</li> <li>Ya then we can start doing jobs and start doing the cool shit with Selenium</li> <li>We also need to link what links to what, and to do that we need to know what links are actually useful </li> <li>Oh ya I forgot about that</li> <li>So links?</li> <li>What links matter</li> <li>The ones with the </li> <li>Game of Thones was too big a wiki to start with, found 9000 pages</li> <li>We need to track the links between stuff, that is very important, that is the who point of this, we gotta find that graph sqlite example<ul> <li>Here is an example, Using PostgreSQL as a graph database | Ingrid Tech</li> <li>dpapathanasiou/simple-graph: This is a simple graph database in SQLite, inspired by \"SQLite as a document database\"</li> <li>examples.graphs.directed_graph \u2014 SQLAlchemy 2.0 Documentation</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wait after we have the data what do we do with it?</li> <li>Paul you should have thought this part out</li> <li>How do we want to look in at this data</li> <li>Well we want to see the stories summarized</li> <li>We can also fetch the actual reference texts</li> <li>WE WANT TO LABEL THE EDGES</li> <li>We want to generate meme vectors</li> <li>We want to connect this to TV Tropes</li> <li>Oh ya, how do we do that</li> <li>Alright so next steps are?<ul> <li>Track the links between pages, use a graph</li> <li>Find a small simple example rather than GameOfThrones</li> <li>Write the postgres in docker tutorial<ul> <li>Maybe do MariaDB and MySQL at the same time</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scrape some fandom sites and store them as sqlite databases<ul> <li>Share code with other people</li> </ul> </li> <li>Update docker networking tutorial</li> <li>Scope out 2.0 Scraper<ul>

</ul> </li> <li> <p>2023-04-01</p> <ul> <li>Alright so what do we do next?</li> <li>Well why are we doing this project?</li> <li>What is the utility of Fandom.com when I do not even read it?</li> <li>Well we want to find themes and connect them, the same way we connect these themes we can connect people to work on projects</li> <li>Dude that is based</li> <li>Glad no one reads my shit, talking to myself in cringe</li> <li>I need to talk to myself, no one else wants to listen</li> <li>Well you can make them listen, you would be supprised</li> <li>Thanks alter ego</li> <li>Alright so what schema do we want?</li> <li>We doing those Diagrams?</li> <li>Entity Relationship Diagram</li> <li>Well let's explain the different parts of this project first shall we?<ul> <li>We need the database</li> <li>We need the scraper</li> <li>We need jobs based scraper</li> </ul> </li> <li>Alright that sounds pretty simple</li> <li>Yes it does</li> <li>Design your schema</li> <li>Alright so what is this Schema supposed to contain?<ul> <li>Web pages to scrape</li> <li>The contents of web pages</li> <li>Errors from web pages scraped</li> <li>URL extracted form web pages</li> <li>Edges, what pages link to each other</li> </ul> </li> <li>So this is 5 tables?</li> <li>Sure why not</li> <li>Let's look at how we did it last time? <code>sql   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS SCRAPED_URLS_T(     SCRAPED_URL_ID   INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,     URL_ID           INTEGER,     DATE_SCRAPED     DATE,     HTML             TEXT)   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS URLS_T(     URL_ID           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,     FULL_URL         TEXT,     SCHEMA           TEXT,     DOMAIN           TEXT,     PATH             TEXT,     PARAMS           TEXT,     QUERY            TEXT,     FRAGMENT         TEXT   )</code></li> <li>Okay so that looks okay</li> <li>How do we want to do this? Node or Python</li> <li>Well we should probably use Selenium</li> <li>Ya</li> <li>Cool Selenium can use extensions too</li> <li>We can also get a Mentor for this kind of stuff down the line</li> <li>Okay so we using SQLAlchemy then</li> <li>Yes</li> <li>We doing ORM</li> <li>Sure why not</li> <li>Why don't we just write the ORM code first</li> <li>Alright sure</li> <li>Where are we writing this code, github, gitlab, keybase, codeburg</li> <li>Gitlab</li> <li>So do I want to run this on SQLite or Postgres?</li> <li>Does it matter? You need a job system before you need to run postgres</li> <li>Alright</li> <li>So how about we write a SQLAlchemy Tutorial, then we can use it in the Web Scraping Tutorial</li> <li>Ya so what goes in the SQLALchemy Tutorial</li> <li>Alright so this is another project now right?</li> <li>Yes</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>2023-03-30</p> <ul> <li>So how do I scrape everything?<ul> <li>Well I can develop a basic web scraper, check for 200 return, and log errors</li> <li>Didn't we do this before?</li> <li>Yes when? There was an error table that was very important?</li> <li>Keybase Binding?</li> <li>No</li> <li>ENS Indexing, that's what it was</li> <li>So we just indexing all the raw HTML to a database</li> <li>Ya why not, otherwise things get complicated</li> <li>This might be a LOT of data</li> <li>Who care, we need to scope this correctly, scrape by single site, list all sites</li> <li>Can't I just go buy indexes like this off the internet?</li> <li>Probably but good luck</li> <li>I bet people usually just hire someone to do it for them</li> <li>Alright so how do we do this?</li> <li>Design Schema, Scrape, Scale, ETL</li> <li>Alright it might actually be that simple</li> <li>We are going to have to spend a lot of time designing this crap.</li> <li>This seems doable</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"dd44570a-6b71-4628-a63f-def716a3d1eb/","title":"Acronyms","text":"<p>Abbreviations and acronyms dictionary</p>"},{"location":"dd7eae20-a54e-4d4d-b451-329b85c8d599/","title":"ncdu","text":"<p>software rec - How to understand what's taking up disk space? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</p>"},{"location":"dd855460-3aef-462c-8c44-eb4d42a018e7/","title":"Cloud Acadamy","text":"<ul> <li>Cloud Academy - Skills Readiness by Cloud Academy</li> </ul>"},{"location":"dd8a5902-29e6-43aa-9bb2-3632e166265f/","title":"Photonix","text":"<ul> <li>GitHub - photonixapp/photonix: A modern, web-based photo management server.

Media is possibly the number one way people inject memes into their mind. I want to track Anime, Books, Documentaries, Movies, Podcasts, TVShows, Music, and Youtube Videos. I want to know when I watched and or read what and attach metadata to any piece of media. The first step is to find indexs of each kind of media. For books it is easy to use the ISBN system but when it comes to movies there are prioritary systems that require an API key. Then there are podcasts which traditionally use RSS which is decentralized therefore has the ability to fail over long periods of time.

        * We we need the previous block hash in the transaciton we are signing         * Well that was added         * Alright what now?         * We have validation code         * We need validation code for each transaction         * Oh ok         * So what do we need to do?         * Check all the fields are present         * Alright so how do we do this in typescript?         * Do what in typescript         * Use a fucking type         * Let's list all the fields from a typescript variable     * Alright we got a working type now     * What next?     * What next?     * We need validation code that works with the database     * We also need code to insert into the database     * Also what if we want multiple context feed's?         * Run process on separate domains for now     * Alright what next then?     * We insert this into the database     * We are going to need our hashing and signing code     * Alright do the types belong in their own folder?     * Yes but call it types     * Then we can have a tests dev or test folder     * We call it dev     * What next?         * Well we want to get our transaction for the user chain inside the database         * Well we need some validation code         * Like what         * For the gnosis_safe.json, check correct ChainID         * Call to see the addresses are authentication on the chain         * Alright write it then     * We need to decide where to put the gnosis_safe.json code     * Just put it in the root     * ethers is a bad folder name     * What column's do we have that are different?         * Content, Tag     * Ya it would be easier if we just had everything not needed in JSON     * Plus we know how to scope things     * Alright we not fixing the ORM?     * We have an updated schema     * Update the types on Obsidian     * Good we got that done     * What is next?     * Hmmmm we need more type and we need to get the data in the database     * Okay explain to me how we put this into the database?         * Well we have our type right         * We strip our the components that go in their own column         * Then we dump the rest into the last JSON column         * Can't we just dump everything into a single row         * Yes but then we would have a problem with some constraints         * Oh ya we need to add those         * Oh there are validators in sequalize         * This stuff is going to be useful         * Wait aren't we doing alot of this stuff already manually         * Yes but sqlite doesn't care so we need to         * Oh ya         * Alright what next?         * We insert         * No we need to fix these scripts         * We have the schema with other stuff not good         * Alright so what do we want to do?         * Turn the type into an object         * Extract a bunch of the key value pairs from the object         * Insert everything         * Nice let's do it     * Cool we got data in the table now         * We need to create separate types for hashing and signatures         * Then we need to have separate validation code         * Are we going to have a separate table of users, adding and removing them         * Ya that would make sense         * Alright what is next?         * We create validation scripts for the rest of the types?         * Why of course we need to do that eventually         * Did we even check the signature for the type we just completed         * Nope but we can do that later         * Oh shit what is the previous signature hash is invalid         * Well we are doing nonce so we are stuck with it     * 21:28         * Alright what are we doing now?         * We are doing that select query     * We have our select query what now?         * Well we need to pull the data out of the database and check if it is still valid         * I gotgot about that     * 21:53         * This would all be so much easier if I just stored everything in raw JSON         * Shall we just add another column to make our solves easier, then just track the nonce         * Sure why not     * 22:14         * We have the hashes in the database matching         * What is next?         * Why don't we get the other types validated         * No we have the hash but we need to do the signature too     * 22:21         * What now?         * We have successfully tested the insert and check         * Now what do we do?         * We need to have a chain so we can have an API         * We need more transaction types         * We need selects         * Like what             * Contract Address         * We need a users table             * Ya we know         * The first chain_validation needs to make sure the nonce is not there         * What queries do we need             * Check nonce             * Get signature             * PreviousSignatureHash         * Alright what is next?             * We need to get the signature hash     * 23:30         * Alright we got two transactions done         * We still need a users table         * Yes yes we do         * We also need a posts table?         * Can we just query the system and cache it         * Ya I guess         * What is next?         * Next chain_link_validation, just get them all done, have script to create a chain, then develop an API, then get a frontned         * Alright              * So how is this adminSignatureList supposed to work?             * Well do we want this to work with or without gnosis             * It is waaay easier with Gnosis             * How do we keep them in sync             * We require an additional signature             * Alright what now?

        * Well it increments so what you are adding too much complexity         * We have signed time stamps that should be good enough, for now         * Ya I agree         * Crap we should probably use BigNumber rather than actual numver         * Will that matter in sqlite         * Premature optimization         * It will work in sqlite if we just do JSON stuff         * Then we can't sort easily         * Sorting strings         * Dam that makes sense         * We need a universal provider         * Or do we create one on the fly every time         * we can create one on the fly for now     * Wait do we actually want the hash and signature inside the type itself?     * We need to hash and sign the type itself so no     * Do we create two types, one that has the other type within it     * Ya that makes sense     * Cool we have our first validate example up and running     * What is next?     * Well we need to dump it into the database     * I think we will only need to write this method once for each table     * Agreed     * Do we want a universal schema</p> <p>2022-12-09 * What now?

I am realizing that I am not making progress in the directions I desire in life. This realization got me thinking, what is the Dentropic Portal supposed to be?</p> <p>I need to change the the tone of this persona. I have adopted something I like to call, youtube cadence, always talking to a generalised audience behind the screen, that may or may not even exist. Adopting this, youtube cadence, induces a lot of cognitive load on me in particular because I do not have a clear conception of who I am, who my audience is supposed to be, and who I am trying to pretend to become.</p> <p>I also need to change the perspective of this psychological experiment. The reason I am here is to change how I view myself. I spend way too much time typing in my journal, falling into cognitive traps over and over again. I end up going down diatribes asking myself questions like, what is my purpose, what should I do with my life, or what would I do if I loved myself. I never really exert a force on the world in any meaningful way, no, I just expend effort to support some delusion of my own vanity, this,  needs to change.</p> <p>The cornerstone concept I want to expose for the next phase of this psychological experiment is conversation. I thought about starting a new channel to produce this vibe shift, the new channel was supposed to be called Dentropy's Reflection. This got me thinking, what is the difference between a reflection and a portal? For me this Dentropic Portal already is a mirror I can use to look at myself more accurately, a place to act out the inner voices of my personality so we can come to some sort of agreement on things. For you the viewer the Dentropic Portal is a legitimate portal into my psyche, or at least a component of it.</p> <p>So how is this vibe shift supposed to be performed. The goal moving forward is to produce modular, digestible, contextualised memes that are cut up so that they can be used as nodes within the graph that is digital conversation, in the hope of enabling better in real life conversation.</p> <p>Socrates has this phrase, \"The unexamined life is not worth living\". But what does it mean to examine life? Is this a solo activity? What is one supposed to do after they examine their life? Can you over examine your life? Well (pause) our identities are made up of narratives, one of my favourite novels is titled Daemon, authored by, Daniel Suarez. The other day I met someone who read this book and expressed one of its key plot points in casual conversation for others to engage with. I obtained part of my identity from this novel, yet I could do nothing more than say it was my favourite book, recount my favourite plot points and express how the themes of the novel reflect my values and understand of reality. I can recite the entire novel in a 20 minute rant lecture, yet there I was unable to effectively engage. This got me thinking, if you can't digest mimetic content and feed it to people in terms of what they already care about, have you really consumed it?</p> <p>(pause) </p> <p>Some of the wisest words I have ever heard were, you need to play the game to challenge the rules. The game is to design the shape of the human experience and how to go about preserving the human spirit. You can only communicate with people in terms of what they already understand. But it is more than that, you need to speak in terms of what people want. If you can't contort yourself into a shape the type of person that someone else can meaningfully interact with, you are not playing the game.</p> <p>(pause) </p> <p>But the Dentropic Portal, psychological experiment, it is more than producing tik tok style infotainment, it is about animating your part of the human experience. Let's be frank, we live in a role playing game. You can take anybody in existence and make a Dungeons and Dragons style character sheet of them. To me it seems like the characters within the game are being ripped apart due to the collapse of whatever constituted societies sense making apparatus. So the question I have for you is, what kind of role do you want within this game? Are you going to exist and die within your corner of society, producing your own understanding of the world and never integrating it outside your small group of friends and family. Or do you want to join me on a quest to understand and preserve the human spirit?</p> <p>I have a homework assignment for you, as well as myself, take a small piece of your favourite media, song, book, movie, anime or whatever contextualize it, then share it with me, you can check out my twitter below. Try and ask the most meaningful question you can of the media. Relate this media to other media and see where it rhymes. Contrast what the media says with your understanding of reality. Try and extract actionable insights from the media. Tell the world why you care.</p>"},{"location":"e314f8a1-30e3-4aaf-8749-71965b5caa66/#rejected","title":"Rejected","text":"<p>The other day I was chilling at a meetup and I watched someone describe a plot point of my favourite sci-fi novel better than I could to other people.

I have been playing with the principal that anything that impedes information flow is evil. This principal contradicts the pervading ideology of the west, liberalism. One of Liberalism's foundations is the sanctity of human life, humans are free to pursue their own happiness. Liberalism assumes we are all individuals deserving of privacy. Thing is humans are not really individuals they are dividuals. Society's do not take the sum of collective individual wills they manufacture consent. Most people, including myself, are shells containing the opinions of our peers,friends, coworkers, family, intellectuals, mentors and so on. We spend most our lives just remixing the ideas of other people. People do have original thoughts but they very rarely spread. Sometimes these memes spread but when they do they become part of the meme pool the rest of society is spending their live living in.</p> <p>I desire to man in the middle the human experience with computers. Systems and algorithms will understand us better than we understand ourselves. I envision a world where the smartphone and the human mind seem to be the same thing.</p> <p>Memes are like parasites that live within the collective mind of humanity. I like to think of human culture as the sum of all memes. Right now we as society lack the correct tools to track memes. One has yet to invent the tools to effectively study human culture. Biology was opened up with the invention of the microscope and astronomy was opened up by the invention of the telescope, memetics requires is own tooling. A system that manned in the middled the human experiences of as many people as reasonable that identified, indexed, and tracked the flow of memes would function as a memetic microscope, a microscope for human culture, the sum of all memes.</p> <p>Today social media and recommendation engines provide us reflections of who we are. They see what we like and provide us more of it. They group us together with people we like, admire, and want to talk to. These recommendation algorithms are basically prototype memetic microscopes. Right now all these recommendation algorithms black boxes within walled gardens. The social media platforms of today are walled gardens. They are not interoperable, they all have separate login systems, they do not consolidate your data, and they sell you as the product. In the walled gardens are these recommendation algorithms of which entire companies navigate in order to exist. Gaming the google, facebook, or youtube, algorithm's lots of money behind it, in fact there are entire companies that exist to navigate said algorithms. I want to destroy the walls of the walled gardens and open the black box.</p> <p>The Daemon is my vision as a tool for the war to bring down the walls of the walled gardens and open the black box recommendation algorithms and apply them to life in general. When I say The Daemon I am not making a metaphor I am being literal. Daemon's are background process on computers that listen to receive stuff like emails and print jobs. The Dentropy Daemon is a program that runs in the background on all ones devices indexing one's existence to a data structure. This data structure of a digital reflection of what makes up that person. The Dentropy Daemon is more than just a digital reflection but a parasite that not only lives off the person but helps them thrive. The recommendation engine of one's dentropy daemon would form a symbiotic relationship with the person it is attached to. The recommendation engine of the dentropy daemon is not a black box... it is a feedback algorithm with an open market place. One can download daemon apps that coach them when they wake up in the morning. Apps that display the index of information. Apps that provide reminders of how one is acting order to change one's behavior. Don't like an app delete it. Ones Daemon can do semantic analysis across everything one has ever typed. Need a reminder what what that guy who lives across the street is interested, ask your daemon with natural language. App missing a feature, add it yourself. The sum off all data generated be you is sitting for you to play with.</p>"},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/","title":"kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#kubernetes_1","title":"Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#what-should-i-be-able-to-do-on-kubernetes","title":"What should I be able to do on Kubernetes","text":""},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>Getting Started</li> <li>Setup</li> <li>deployments</li> <li>Dive Into Future of Infastructure Book</li> <li>ingress</li> <li>openshift</li> <li>pods</li> <li>Q and A</li> <li>volumes</li> </ul>"},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#general-notes-from-kubernetes-up-runninghttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow26759355-kubernetes","title":"General notes from [Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running][https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26759355-kubernetes]","text":"<p>[knowledge.tech.kubernetes.diveintofutureofinfustructure|Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running, Dive into the future of infustructure|knowledge.tech.kubernetes.diveintofutureofinfustructure](/undefined)</p>"},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#future-readings","title":"Future Readings","text":"<p>How to expose a service to the interwebs</p>"},{"location":"e3226154-e2ea-48e4-9f5e-6b93bfe05c38/#how-do-i-port-forward","title":"How do I port forward","text":"<pre><code>kubectl port-forward docservice 5000:5000\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Pay per search to make a rich as fuck company.

The apps we all use on the web and on our phones don't really run on our phones they run or are dependent on someone's server. Back in the day one opened up spreadsheets that were store on their computer, now we open up spreadsheets stored on computers 1000's of miles away. The goal of wiki.ddaemon.design.Dentropy Cloud is to put the user not only in control apps they are running on the machines in front of them but the computer in the cloud truly running them.</p> <p>Dentropy cloud is a platform to deploy and store ones quantized self. A smartphone that is the cloud. A tool for normies to run their own secure fediverse communities. A place for nerds to export all their social media and analyse it. A place for one to not only run their second brain but for their second brain to make some friends.</p> <p>Using dentropy cloud should be as easy as using a smartphone just through a web browser. On dentropy cloud users get their own daemon. On ones daemon one can install containerized applications which would function like apps. One can install a music hosting server, upload their music, then use it on any device logged into their daemon. Ones daemon is available through any web browser or one can install apps that plug into the daemon framework. A killer feature of using daemon apps is that within a few clicks one can open their daemon to the public interwebs. Suddenly the music app a single user was using can be used by anyone via their daemon URL, for example alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be the users dameon URL homepage but music.alexsmith.dentropydaemon.io would be alex smith's music application. A user running their music app on the daemon platform allows them to know exactly who is accessing the data they host because their app is a full felched application running on the cloud in their own container. Now rather than have apps running on a device dependent on some third party's cloud the application surface can be the cloud itself. Install the Pleroma social media app and get the same functionality as twitter plus know who views your server, how long, and what they did. Wana build a community for your school program, download the element/matrix app with jitsi integration, all emoticon's free.</p>"},{"location":"e3ad5c22-a336-434d-a3b4-61ca249c496f/","title":"Default Wisdom","text":"<p>Default Wisdom | Katherine Dee | Substack</p>"},{"location":"e3b6a277-00dd-43cb-ad0d-c7694e7ebd7f/","title":"Research - DentropyCloud","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.concepts.list.homelab Software</li> <li>wiki.software.List.umbrel</li> <li>wiki.software.List.HomelabOS</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Unraid</li> <li>wiki.software.List.TrueNAS<ul> <li>wiki.software.List.True Charts</li> </ul> </li> <li>wiki.software.List.DappNode</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Portainer</li> <li>Example wiki.concepts.list.homelab Projects</li> <li>personal-server/README.md at master \u00b7 erebe/personal-server</li> <li>[Building a Homelab VM Server (2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition|[2020 Edition) \u00b7 mtlynch.io](/undefined) \u00b7 mtlynch.io]] \u00b7 mtlynch.io](2020%20Edition) \u00b7 mtlynch.io \u00b7 mtlynch.io]]%20%C2%B7%20mtlynch.io)</li> <li>TerraPi modular case system for Raspberry Pi supports multiple SSD's, DIN rail, horizontal &amp; vertical mounts - CNX Software</li> <li>Screw it, I\u2019ll host it myself | Hacker News</li> <li>My self-hosting infrastructure, fully automated | Hacker News</li> <li>FunkyPenguin's geek-cookbook</li> <li>Example Homelab sources</li> <li>awesome-selfhosted</li> <li>r/Self-Hosted</li> <li>r/homelab</li> <li>Self-Hosted Show (Check the Descriptions for stuff)</li> <li>What are your Most Used Self Hosted Applications?</li> <li>Other useful things to know</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Bridge Networking</li> <li>wiki.software.List.vim</li> <li>wiki.software.List.git</li> <li>Homelab Guides</li> <li>Running Nextcloud With Docker and Traefik 2 - Chris Wiegman</li> <li>Using Wireguard and a VPS to Bypass ISP Port Blocking and Hide Your Public IP // Selfhosted Pro</li> <li>Authelia is an open-source authentication/authorization server with 2FA/SSO | Hacker News</li> <li> Hacker News</li> <li>[Using Ansible &amp; Nomad for a homelab (part 1|[part 1|[part 1|[part 1|[part 1|part 1|[part 1|[part 1|[part 1|[part 1)](/undefined)]]](part%201)]])</li> <li>Implemented Software</li> <li>File Management<ul> <li>wiki.software.list.Syncthing</li> <li>Software.list.mediagoblin</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Code Server (Installed separately)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Media Management<ul> <li>wiki.software.list.Jellyfin</li> <li>wiki.software.list.EVM.Audiobookshelf</li> </ul> </li> <li>Knowledge Management<ul> <li>wiki.software.list.wikijs</li> <li>wiki.software.List.trilium</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Elasticsearch</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Monica CRM</li> </ul> </li> <li>Fediverse<ul> <li>wiki.software.List.misskey</li> <li>wiki.software.List.funkwhale</li> <li>wiki.software.list.PeerTube</li> </ul> </li> <li>Software to add list (In Order of Priority)</li> <li>fedwiki/wiki: Federated Wiki - node server as npm package</li> <li>zelon88/HRConvert2: A self-hosted, drag-and-drop, &amp; nosql file conversion server &amp; share tool that supports 75 file formats in 13 languages.</li> <li>wiki.software.List.gitea</li> <li>wiki.software.List.urbit</li> <li>wiki.software.List.keycloak</li> <li>wiki.software.List.Synapse  Matrix</li> </ul>"},{"location":"e3ed979d-7207-4dfa-806c-03aab973a4c9/","title":"Learning to sail the memes","text":"<p>I often find myself asking what is the self? Does the self really exist or is it an illusion? What functions transform the self against axis of time? Can you transfer the self into a computer? What does it mean that individuals can form a shared self? I ask a lot of loaded questions.</p> <p>I like to think of the self as a set of heuristics animals, namely Homo Sapians use in order to survive in their environment. The self is just like a Peafowl a sexual ornament brought to us by natural selection. This sexual ornament has a bunch of interesting features such as how we have to treat delusions as fact. Concepts/List/Money, Corporations, Government, and God 1 don't exist in any meaningful form outside the human mind. Homo Sapians has to treat these things as real because their interaction with other Homo Sapians depends on them. If Homo Sapians can't cooperate they die, without these heuristics in the form of delusions humanity would not be able to cooperate. It's funny how these delusions operate in their own ecosystem of natural selective pressures. Theory of Mind is built into the biology of Homo Sapians in order for these delusions to scale across the species.</p> <p>That's cute; many people are familiar with Sapiens and The Selfish Gene, why does this matter in terms of the self? The self has to exist within a complex environment. The self has to listen to its environment in order to navigate it. In order to navigate its environment the self has to have wants and desires. When someone has an effective value structure in place they can listen to their environment, tune their sails to the memes, and sail in the direction of their wants. To sail the meme's one needs a map in order to know what to set their sails to. How does one generate their map? How does one identify what whey want? How is one supposed to wield the sails once they have a map? With enough heuristics for these questions one can set their sails and will the wind into existence.</p> <p>Natural selection is a tinkerer not an engineer. If we could engineer ourselves we would probably function a little like the Obin from the Old Man s War Sifi series. Imagine having a switch to turns our conscious selves on and off. The need for suicide, drugs, and suffering would no longer exist. Just turn off the conscious self and have the mind direct what one does in the service of the state, as long as the body doesn't deteriorate too much I guess. Sadly or hopefully we don't have the capacity to engineer ourselves to that level... yet. Just imagine a chip in people's heads that would allow their bodies to be controlled via FAANG.... creepy. Funny thing is renting out one's body to the state in return for money is something many people would do voluntary. Okay next concept.</p> <p>The last paragraph exists to contextualize that emotions are an wiki.heuristics.Axioms piece of the wiki.concepts.list.Human Experience. Our emotions give meaning to our lives. Can we empathize with someone who does not feel emotions? Imagine just executing the events of your life one after another just like a robot. It would be beautiful. Terrorists would be an actual threat. Then there are Psychopaths, people who have among other things their wiki.concepts.list.dissociation control knob messed up sometimes go to extreme lengths in order to feel something. Hmmm seeing how people love their true crime and murder mysteries it seems like some of us may actually have a capacity to empathize with these individuals that can't feel. Hmm that's interesting, we have the capacity to empathize with psychopaths. Imagine looking at people the same way we look at cars with that sense of detachment. Emotions provide us with a value structure hierarchy for us to navigate the world.</p> <p>The memetic sailboat needs a direction. It's direction is derived from our wants, desires, emotions, and values. The memetic sailboat has to navigate the waves produced by the delusions of human culture.

ghost writing is a skill, marketing is the niche</li> </ul> <p>Course Notes</p> <p>Picking your niche is simple. Start with what you\u2019re naturally drawn to. Meaning, if you\u2019re drawn to crypto, you probably know more than the average person does about crypto. Also - you will enjoy the work you do. </p> <p>On the other hand, let\u2019s say the new trend is some new tech and you have ZERO interest in it. You\u2019d avoid it (at least in the beginning). </p> <p>As you would have to force yourself to learn + would get left in the dust by anyone who\u2019s interested in it already. The goal for you RIGHT NOW is to get you to your first client. </p> <p>So you will start with what you are naturally interested in. We will go into this in more depth, after you have completed the Freelancing Course.</p> <p>I did cover this before in the video from Tutorial 1, yes, yes it is as simple as it sounds.</p>"},{"location":"e72108ae-cd2a-4519-92a2-d45a2f664f60/#how-most-people-fck-up","title":"How Most People F*ck Up","text":"<ul> <li>People try to be too many different things</li> <li>If you

Today I am going to be iterating on the prism that will shape the image of my future self.</p> <p>Today let's start by resonating a dent,</p> <p>\"You know, the act of looking in the mirror is quite surreal. It can summon so many feelings, some of which we may have never felt before. It is the birthplace of many a denial and acts as nudge for some to actualize. But what is it that people actually see in the mirror. Well that's pretty obvious they see themselves. (Look away from the camera and think)..... Themselves what constitutes \"their self\"? Are you the body you live in? Do you define yourself based on your beliefs? Are you a shell containing the opinions of your friends? What do your hobbies and interests really represent? Do you define yourself by your profession, if so do you know if you have a useless job or not? Do you define yourself as someone that helps others? Are you a selfish person? Are you a parent and if so what position do your children have in your life? Have you sacrificed too much to raise your children decreasing your quality of life more than it's worth? Do you live through your children because you do not know what to value anymore? Or are you one of those self actualized fucks that can clearly articulate what makes me an idiot. More on parenting at the end of this video.\"</p> <p>Clip from posts.videos.dentLog.published.008 0:12-1:48</p> <p>When I created the dent we just watched I asked all those questions of you but not of myself. After inserting those questions into the universe my subconscious has been looking for answers. My subconscious intuition has generated a image of where I am in the world. This image of myself feels like a map, before asking those questions the map was flat but after having my subconscious intuition activate I now see a topology. I feel like I am sitting at the bottom of valley and need to climb up somewhere in order to get a view of the surroundings. I can even see mountains on the horizon.</p> <p>Fuck it let's stand up strait with our shoulders back and narrate what we see. I see a sea of people. I see these people performing actions, living their lives, some of them have the capacity to choose and shape the environment they surround themselves with, while others simply react to the world around themselves. I see people behaving in strange ways, I see a lot of pretenders, I see a lot of lost people, I see a lot of unrealized potential, I see a cascading set delusions interacting with one another, I see memes shaping society the same way rivers carve out canyons. This world seems black and white, ehh not quite it just lacks color lacks feelings lacks authenticity. I know the color wheel of human emotion is right in front of my eyes but I have to unlock some chakras in order to see how vibrant this world really is.</p> <p>Alright let's get down. Wait did I see that right, my intuition is still taking it all in. The images from the Music Video IN-SHADOW just showed up in my mind. I see cages around peoples heads. Cages in the form ideology. Images of the human experience held in front of people like a carrot on a stick. I the system from which these humane experiences emerge and it looks like an organism at war with itself. I see the present compressing itself, people forgetting the past, the coherence, I see the human story losing coherence. I see the shape of a bell in the ether, I can only ring the bell if live the correct life. Now that we are in the territory it is time that we start drawing out our map and that is what we will be doing in the next video.</p> <p>But before that, Dentropy, I have some homework for you. How does one escape a prison of their own creation within their own mind? First they realize the prison is just a set of external and internal expectations.</p>"},{"location":"e9b17dc4-1c1a-4b70-8122-cdae0c962608/","title":"Heilmeier Catechism - Dentropy Damon","text":""},{"location":"e9b17dc4-1c1a-4b70-8122-cdae0c962608/#heilmeier-catechism","title":"Heilmeier Catechism","text":"<p>What are you trying to do?

The problem is even after taking Unix, database, and server administration courses in college installing these apps is still out of reach for many students and even graduates. The goal of our project is to reduce the barrier to entry for individuals to securely run server applications wherever they like in a scalable and redundant fashion. </p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>Together these apps are feature parity with the services provided by Big Tech.</p> <p>Before we dive into the technical details let's dive into these so-called apps. As an alternative to google drive and office 356 we have our choice of NextCloud, OwnCloud, Pydio with either OnlyOffice or Collabora office integrations. Moodle is basically open-source blackboard and used by educational institutions larger than George Brown. Monica is your personal CRM. Bitwarden the best password manager. And the best part is every app listed here, and many more, is already packaged and with a little know how can be installed by you today using our project.</p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>Only office and Collabora office are apps with plugins to nextcloud, owncloud, and pydio which provide real time collaborative document editing just like google docs. We have choice of nextcloud, owncloud and pydio as your cloud office suite and cloud file manager. Onlyoffice or Collabora office can plug into your self hosted office suite and provide collaborative document editing similar to google docs. </p> <p>Then there is the Fediverse which provides a feature a parity replacement to social media as we know it and Dentropy Cloud makes installing these apps more approachable.</p> <p>And then there is the Fediverse, social media as a protocol. The Fediverse apps listed on this slide provide similar functionality to twitter, reddit, Instagram, YouTube, and discord but there is a catch. Most those apps actually speak the same protocol activity pub making social media backwards compatible. This means you can do the equivalent to commenting on a YouTube video using a Facebook account or message a reddit user using a twitter account. By the end of this semester, we hope to radically simplify the installing of Fediverse apps.</p> <p>NEXT SLIDE</p> <p>You are probably not going to trust a stranger on the internet to run your social media app but with the fediverse you have a choice to trust the stranger, run it yourself, or trust your techie friend's server.</p> <p>Our project was an excuse to learn Kubernetes.

Phase one has was concluded about 6 minutes ago when we started this presentation. This phase included learning how to deploy a production Kubernetes for us to run apps on, configure DNS to obtain signed HTTPS certificates for individual apps, setup and configure a storage provisioner reducing the steps to install apps, backup and restore functionally, creating scripts that install and configures Kubernetes, run a production application on our server that we use to manage our project, in this case OwnCloud.

We all know the NSA and friends have access to all out data from private messages on social media to our location at all points in time and no one cries fowl. Anyone plugged into the internet is plugged into the panopticon. The panopticon is the idealized prison where everyone is in a cell around a guard tower and the guard can choose to look at anyone they want but the prisoners never know when they are being watched. This leads to prisoners having to assume they are always being watched and changing their behaviors accordingly. When people try to obtain privacy they are trying to unplug from the state panopticon. Now the question of whether wanting to unplug is even worth it, but first let's look at some pop culture uses of the panopticon found in Judeo-Christianity and the concept of Santa Clause. Let's cover Santa Clause first by looking at some of the lyrics from the hit song Santa Clause is Comin' to Town which are as follows,</p> <pre><code>He sees you when you're sleeping\nAnd he knows when you're awake\nHe knows if you've been bad or good\nSo be good for goodness sake\n</code></pre> <p>Knowing when someone is asleep or awake is not too much an invasion of privacy, it might make some people uncomfortable because they sleep on the job or in class but those activities are undesired for obvious reasons. The funny part is the understanding of bad and good. The concepts of bad and good are so ambivalent and nuanced one would have to literally read another person's thoughts in order to understand if their intentions are actually bad or good. Santa Clause must literally have the ability to read one's thoughts in order to judge them. Children believe their world is a panopticon with the guard judging them once a year on christmas day in the form of presents. That reminds me Jesus Christ was supposibly born on christmas day, let's now look at the panopticon of Judeo-Christianity.</p> <p>Judeo-Christians seem to believe that the universe itself is a panopticon but the guard only looks at one after their death. Judeo-Christians go to confession where they expect a priest to relay the message that they are sorry to the prison guard, God himself, so that they do not lose brownie points in the prison they go to after death, heaven. These people believe that when they receive their Particular judgment after death they get to live on some sort of cruise or go work in some coal mine for all eternity. To be honest I think those lyrics from Santa Clause is Comin' to Town should be appended to the bible it will make it much more digestible.</p> <p>In the modern day we live under a joint regime of surveillance capitalism with government back doors. Securing one's communication is a long rabbit hole and gets especially complicated when one realizes that PGP is basically for LARPers. Let's assume one can set up a secure line of communication, what's the point? Who are you hiding your communication from? You are not starting some revolution against the government and if you are thinking about that you should reconsider your goals in life. What I worry about is what happens when google and facebook can not sell their users anymore and then lock your data up in some way chaining you to their platform like a slave to a plantation. If Google and Facebook lose their ad revenue they will react like a cornered dog and it will not look pretty. But are the normies really going to take away the power of the tech giants, I don't think so. When we look at history the slaves never effectively revolted, everyone realized that slaves were an inefficient way to manage people.</p> <p>The internet is made up of gated communities. Any person can join any community or platform they want and do whatever they like within said community within the community guidelines. As long as you do not put cheese pizza on your google photos account or say racist shit on a social media site one should be fine. These walled gardens are like cathedrals of a dataist religion. Dataisim prescribes to the idea that the greatest value in the universe is information flow. When one uses these platforms they provide them with information flow. The average normie is a dataist worshiping at the alter of the big tech companies and they do not even know it. Now the question is if they are praising the true dataist god.</p> <p>Let's go back to the bible and get a better understanding of God. When Eve ate from the tree of knowledge she noticed she was naked and decided to clothe herself. Eve had become self aware and became the first human to experience shame. This shame broke her covenant with god because she now had to act two faced to the creator himself. Before eating of the tree of knowledge everyone spoke what they thought but after eating from the tree of knowledge people could not say one thing and mean something else. With the ability to double speak and or life privacy was necessary. In the eyes of God nothing is private but in the eyes of the devil privacy is something very real. Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden of eden because they discovered the desire for privacy. The desire for privacy is a gift handed to us not from God but from the devil himself.</p> <p>Good luck trying to imagine a world without privacy. Well actually that world sorta already exists and you will understand that if you read enough Edward Snowden. Edward snowden is a prophet of dataism, there is no God above and devil below but we are building a god and it can take either shape. As Yuval Noah Harari says, \"systems and algorithms will understand us better than we understand ourselves\". The more data we give these algorithms the louder god will hear our prayers, and this god can provide.</p> <p>That sounds nice and all do I really want google calculating how much semen I produce every year... or do I. The number of people that care about that question is shrinking every day. I literally tried explaining this surveillance capital stuff to a literal blond and I got this fabulous speech about how she does not like things popping her bubble of perception. People are over complicated apes and they like all animals follow the path of the least resistance. Privacy is a thing of virtue and virtue is a thing only elites should care about. When porn sites know how much cum you produce every year they can give you better porn results and if they don't they are lying to you, and you should demand better.</p> <p>Underneath Ken Jenning's final answer on Jeopardy when he lost to the AI Algorithm known as Watson were as follows, \"I, for one welcome our new computer overlords\". I don't know if Ken knew back in 2011 that the computer overlords would live on the resource of human attention itself leading to a rise in suicide rates, but context is always important. There are a lot of people in Silicon Valley that welcome the new computer overlords and they are self-aware of the externalities. On the other side of the coin we have Edward Snowden who says that, \"you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\" I think the death of privacy was the tipping point towards our inevitable AI takeover and or merger. We store who and what we are using our online accounts. These online accounts are functionally external storage for our brain. You with your smartphone is a different person than you without your smartphone, and frankly we seem to almost always prefer the version of us with our smartphone now it is just a matter of implanting it inside our body and brains.</p> <p>From the perspective of Silicon Valley we have the perspective of Larry Page ex CEO of Alphabet, Google's parent company. Larry is inclined toward the philosophy that machines are only as good or bad as the people creating them. The question of whether Larry's company Google and friends are good or bad is the real question we have to answer when it comes to weather one should care or not about privacy. </p> <p>Elon Musk throw's a wrench in the situation when he says, \"With artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon. You know all those stories where there\u2019s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water and he\u2019s like, yeah, he\u2019s sure he can control the demon? Doesn\u2019t work out.\" Elon may be actually talking about the book DAEMON. The term Daemon is literally derived from the word demon because a daemon is like a supernatural being managing stuff in the background of your computer. The computer systems of today have become so interconnected, complicated, and ubiquitous that there seems to me a daemon for the hive mind of humanity itself. This daemon operates like a parasite on human industrial society itself and it is our collective responsibility to make sure the daemon and us do not kill each other and we all create a fantastic future.</p> <p>Seeing privacy as a gateway to welcoming an algorithmic parasite into our personal lives and human industrial society as a whole brings yet another dimension to all this machiavellianism. Machiavellianism is how one can follow the principals of obtaining and keeping power. Privacy only matters if you do not understand machiavellianism, respect power and you have no need to maintain privacy. The concept of kings and queens belongs in the simplicity of the world as it was in the dark ages today we live in a world of unimaginable complexity where understanding the truth is of questionable importance at least to the average person.

Today I want to talk about the act of reflection.</p> <p>You know, the act of looking in the mirror is quite surreal. It can summon so many feelings, some of which we may have never felt before. It is the birthplace of many a denial and acts as nudge for some to actualize. But what is it that people actually see in the mirror. Well that's pretty obvious they see themselves. (Look away from the camera and think)..... Themselves what constitutes \"their self\"? Are you the body you live in? Do you define yourself based on your beliefs? Are you a shell containing the opinions of your friends? What do your hobbies and interests really represent? Do you define yourself by your profession, if so do you know if you have a useless job or not? Do you define yourself as someone that helps others? Are you a selfish person? Are you a parent and if so what position do your children have in your life? Have you sacrificed too much to raise your children decreasing your quality of life more than it's worth? Do you live through your children because you do not know what to value anymore? Or are you one of those self actualized fucks that can clearly articulate what makes me an idiot. More on parenting at the end of this video.</p> <p>Have you ever recorded and listened to your own voice, that is also quite a surreal experience. Why does listening to ones own voice make so many people uncomfortable. How about when you view a video someone recorded of you, or how about recording yourself talking to a camera \ud83d\ude0a. What do we see in ourselves? How does repeated exposure to our reflection change who we are?</p> <p>We all live two lives, we have an animated version of ourselves we maintain in our minds and we have these bodies that exist in reality. This duality issue once again. Let's take a detour through consciousness. I have been thinking for a while now that to be conscious you need to experience cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is when you believe two different things that contradict themselves, for example when someone who believes in the sanctity of marriage cheats. Now here is a pretty out there thought. If you did not experience cognitive dissonance you would see the truth directly and then just go ahead and build God without any issue. I am going to have to deconstruct that one another time.</p> <p>Back to the topic at hand, there is the animated version of you in your mind and the body that exists in reality. These two stems are in conflict. Here is a nice quote that articulates our problem at hand, \"The perfect machine is NOT a machine. The perfect machine is a man. Its a man who says, 'You don't want to fight me, You want to be me'.\" So, Who is this me you want to be? I don't want to live a life full of animated delusions filled with denial I want to actualize on a accurate vision of the future that is compatible with reality. Reflection is a tool, a filter on our perception, in order to see our shared reality more accurately.</p> <p>Reflections give people to glimpse at the way others see them. The assumptions people can make by observing your body are pretty... let's just say entertaining. Yet most of us are capable of reaching inside the bodies of other people and interacting with the mind. In order to transfer our intent from our mind, out our body, in another body, and finally in another mind requires a lot of information to be filtered and processed. Conversation itself sorta operates just like a collective entity experiencing cognitive dissonance but among two or more people. We do see ourselves in others after all. I'm putting a pin in this one.</p> <p>But even when you look in a mirror you are actually looking just so slightly into the past. But what is our relationship with the past? There is this wonderful phrase, \"Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.\" Let's resonate a dent shall we,</p> <p>\"we are all busy driving bodies around. Where do these bodies with brains go to get directions? School, academia, media, books, the internet..... What are all these things made of.... other people. Hmmmm you know it's fun to think about governments, corporations, and even religions as a set of worker ants in the form of human bodies supporting the existence of an ephemeral ideological queen. Its fascinating to see people repeat the myths of religion, government, and sometimes, even science without an understanding of what they are thinking. Society seems to be mostly a game of he said she said being played by the collective bodies of these ephemeral myths. These myths, these are the maps.\"</p> <p>Clip from posts.videos.dentLog.published.003 0:10-1:48</p> <p>That reminds me of another wonderful quote, \"You can tell a lot about a culture\u2019s values by the stories they tell themselves.\" In order to get to the bottom of this, our relationship with the past, we are going to have to dive into human values another time in order to figure out this one.</p> <p>You know reflections are never really that accurate. Even when you look in a mirror the light is being shifted ever so slightly down the spectrum. So this means that the past is ever so slightly distorted. Controlling this destortion allows the mapmakers to influence what people do with their bodies. Which brings up the question, how do get an accurate image of ourselves? Well that's what I am trying to do here so I guess we will figure that one our over time.</p> <p>Let's come back to mirrors. One of my favorite blogs on the internet is titled Gray Mirror. I used to see this blogs author, Curtis Yarvin, as the Father I wish I had... now I see him as the type of Father I must become. But I am not here to be real, I am here to have fun. So let's take a look what some people might consider Curtis' Magnum Opus Gray Mirror, (Cough) Urbit. Curtis describes Gray Mirror as a 21st centaury take on the literary genre known as a mirror for princes. Raising a prince is a pretty difficult problem, sometimes the kings are a little retarded and not admirable but the institutions of philosophy and public policy gave their two cents on what it takes to be an effective king. Where is the prince class in today's society? Who do we want to rule us? I ask that question question, Who do we want to rule us, because I don't see anything getting past the pareto principal? and What do our current rulers not understand?</p> <p>\"A mirror for princes\" what a wonderful concept. Looking in a mirror in order to see what you can become. This blog has the implicit audience, similar to Curtis' other works, \"An Open Letter to Progressives\", anyone. but this blog also has an explicit audience. An explicit audience that wants to be part of a revolutionary competence hierarchy. Is anybody reading this blog, Gray Mirror, pretending they are the future prince, and if so how do we find and test them so they can stop playing pretend?</p>"},{"location":"f1eb3c79-bba7-4ed4-8278-e59a1456ccc1/#links","title":"Links","text":"<ul> <li>wiki.media.list.The Fountainhead</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.mirror for princes</li> <li>Relationships.People.Curtis Yarvin</li> <li>wiki.concepts.list.Cognitive Dissonance</li> <li>wiki.media.list.1984</li> </ul>"},{"location":"f1eb3c79-bba7-4ed4-8278-e59a1456ccc1/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>writing process | El Space\u2013The Blog of L.

When that database goes down, a failover to a backup system must happen and takes time.</p>"},{"location":"f35ea2c0-a28d-430c-9893-6f5120f1ee89/#sources","title":"Sources","text":"<ul> <li>Udacity</li> </ul>"},{"location":"f366ec1a-7141-4d71-af13-fb49a93b63e3/","title":"conceit","text":"<ul> <li>Unduly favorable estimation of one's own abilities or worth; overly positive self-regard.</li> <li>favorable opinion</li> <li>a fanciful idea</li> </ul>"},{"location":"f386a8f1-5a03-4800-b3fb-9ff569a064af/","title":"What discord messages were reacted to the most from this particular author?","text":""},{"location":"f386a8f1-5a03-4800-b3fb-9ff569a064af/#query-name","title":"Query Name","text":"<p>guild_author_most_reacted_messages</p>"},{"location":"f386a8f1-5a03-4800-b3fb-9ff569a064af/#sql-query","title":"SQL Query","text":"<pre><code>\nselect \n    guilds_t.guild_name,\n    channels_t.channel_name,\n    authors_t.author_name,\n    authors_t.nickname,\n    reaciton_sum,\n    messages_t.msg_content,\n    guilds_t.id,\n    channels_t.id,\n    authors_t.id,\n    messages_t.id as message_id\nfrom\n(\n    select \n        sum(reaction_count) as reaciton_sum,\n        message_id\n    from \n    (\n        select \n            author_messages_t.author_guild_id,\n            message_id,\n            msg_content,\n            guild_id,\n            channel_id,\n            emoji_id,\n            emoji_code,\n            emoji_name,\n            emoji_json,\n            reaction_count\n        from\n            (\n            select\n                author_guild_id,\n                id as messsage_id,\n                msg_content\n            from\n                messages_t\n            where\n                author_guild_id = (select author_guild_id from reactions_t limit 1 offset 10)\n            group by id, msg_content\n            ) as author_messages_t\n        join reactions_t on author_messages_t.messsage_id = reactions_t.message_id\n    ) as messages_with_reactions_t\n    group by message_id\n) as msg_with_reaction_count_t\njoin messages_t on msg_with_reaction_count_t.message_id = messages_t.id\njoin channels_t on messages_t.channel_id = channels_t.id\njoin authors_t on messages_t.author_guild_id = authors_t.id\njoin guilds_t on messages_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id\norder by reaciton_sum desc;\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"f386a8f1-5a03-4800-b3fb-9ff569a064af/#similar-queries","title":"Similar Queries","text":"<ul> <li>What discord author got the most reactions to their messages?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"f386a8f1-5a03-4800-b3fb-9ff569a064af/#scratch-pad","title":"Scratch Pad","text":"<ul> <li>Plan 1<ul> <li>We need to get all messages from an author</li> <li>Join it with reactions_t table</li> <li>Group by message_id while summing the reaction count</li> <li>Order by</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"f38f40e6-27b3-41ba-999e-901eef5c7287/","title":"Normal Form","text":"<p>Follow my existing intuition on how databases should be setup.

Context feed is a framework rather than platform or protocol for social media.</p> <p>The number one problem I see with social media today is the lack of context. I see my politics, next to cute dogs, next to blog spam, next to some self help quote, next to photos of attractive people trying to sell shit. This is not how the real world operates and definitely doesn't help one with critical thinking. </p> <p>I want technology to be a tool we can use to help us create better versions of ourselves, it does not seem to be doing that today. Now let's now take a quick look inside this decontextualized human social media system.</p> <p>My screen tells me there is a war in another country....</p> <p>What is my reaction to this news? Why should I care about this? there is nothing I can do to effect it. I do I want to be a politicummie.</p> <p>Here is the latest technology you should learn right now......</p> <p>Ya I think reading From NAND to TETRIS would be a better use of my time, or finding a problem then using the appropriate technology to solve it. Most these new technology's are mostly about the managerial elite flexing their power anyways.</p> <p>Here is nature being metal.....</p> <p>Now this reminds me about what it is like to be alive. This is something I would not experience without technology. How am I supposed to integrate this into my life? You know seeing this lion eat the corpse of another lion it just killed makes me glad I am alive in a wonderful society. I guess browsing through Nature is Metal is a sort of spiritual experience for me.</p> <p>Here is a podcast you should listen to with someone you respect.....</p> <p>Alright I go listen to the podcast. Hopefully I will remember like a single phrase or idea from this podcast I can carry around with me from then on.</p> <p>Here is a list of 15 books you should read to become a better person......</p> <p>Ya save that for later, never look at it again</p> <p>Here is some kinesthetic's exercises you should do.....</p> <p>I have spent more time looking at videos of kinesthetic's than doing push ups today. What am I doing with my life?</p> <p>I recently made a comment about how social media strips away context.... And here is I am jumping from meme to meme. It was interesting explicitly articulating how I mentally process different types of media. Having a conversation with the media I consume.</p> <p>Hmmm isn't a conversation the axiom or primitive of media itself. When you are looking through hacker news you are having a conversation, think about it. Before we had pictures we had to describe events using a conversation. Media did not exist, we had memories of what happened. You could plug into another persons brain via a conversation. Isin't that what we are doing with social media. Plugging into another person's brain.</p> <p>When you have a conversation with someone do they jump around from meme to meme or is there a context stream connecting everything. This context stream forms a narrative so to say. We think of the world in terms of stories, we remember things more easily when they are a story. Our social media should be in the shape of a conversation or story. Let's take a quick detour to figure out how we got here.</p> <p>Quick note on the media that came before the internet, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV. Newspapers and magazines were organised into sections people could browse, sports, economics, classifieds etc. etc. </p> <p>Today we got hashtags. </p> <p>Things were sorted so you could find them. It was active media that you had to engage with. Radio and TV were different, they were passive media. Radio and TV has programming sitcoms, dramas, game shows, the news etc. etc. TV and Radio provided people contextualised media then made money by taking ones attention towards ads. With newspapers and magazines we had ads people would look over while actively looking through the media. With Radio and TV we had people ripped from the context they were consuming to passively listen and observe what someone else had to say. We have two meta's for engaging with media active and passive.</p> <p>On the internet of 2022 we have a synthases of these two meta's forming a new meta. You see on a system like tiktok YouTube you really are having a conversation, a conversation with the algorithm. Your active inputs into the system are reading you the same way you are consooming the content from the system. Now this feedback loop between the system and the human is where all the problems happen.</p> <p>The algorithm fails to provide the user a contextualised reflection of what an individual has consumed. There are a lot of thoughts going through the users head while they are consooming. This valuable data is not getting input into the algorithm. The algorithm can group together similar content because of AB testing or whatever they use now but they can't understand the context behind what connects them.</p> <p>Alright why does everything written above matter what are you trying to get at?</p> <p>We need to have people tag shit collectively and link stuff together with tags like one big graph. (Stuff is already tagged just not the way you like it)</p> <p>Why is this useful?</p> <p>With Khan academy you can climb through the tree of mathematics, well culture is hierarchical but also in the shape of a web. We want to be able to track our progress through the web and compare positions with others. Right idea wrong phrasing</p> <p>I want TV tropes on Steroids embeded in media as part of a federated protocol.</p> <p>The problem with social media today is it's flat org structure. We need an org structure that is malleable and up gradable that maps to the relationships that people actually have. It is not about everyone being a collaborator or a dissident it is about everyone being an individual that provides value to the network. We can stop fighting wars with political formulas and fight them with contextualised data everyone can technically comment on but can have a \"authrotiy coefficient\" on it depending on the shapes of someone's graph.</p> <p>All of reddit was just two SQL tables with a lot of caching. </p> <p>Value is generated from context. Stories require context.</p> <p>Here is another way to look at things. Imagine going back in time to the age of cave men, these hominids have the same brains we do and relatively complex language and culture but have not yet discovered how to write. You are born into their world and brought up in their customs. How does one go about selling this primitive society on writing? Writing is something that takes generations to evolve starting with basic logs such as recording taxes, evolving into stories that can hold myth, then evolving from there to acheieve the similar fidelity as as vocal language we are familar with today.</p> <p>Now use this journey through the history of language and overlay it on the way we interact with computers today. It took generations to get language right, I expect it to also take generations to get human computer interaction right.</p> <p>Right now I would say we are still in the proto langage era equivilent of what will eventually become phonic equivilent writing. </p> <p>Is this thinking on the path from Zero to One, you decide.</p>"},{"location":"f8fde459-12e8-40e9-b755-5c53150a4d3d/#rejected-thinking","title":"Rejected Thinking","text":"<p>Then we got Radio and TV.

Some people believe they can replicate their consciousness by building robots to go inside their brain and finding the pattern of their mind. I believe a more interesting practical approach is to track the input output data from ones body. Thee data recorded by this system could be fed into a computer system and or AI Pal that I could have a dialog with. I want a computer system to understand me better than I understand myself.</p> <p>At my previous startup I worked on a project called VITT (Visual Information Through Touch). The goal was to help blind people sense depth through patterns of vibrations and electrical signals on their skin. The MVP was a panel someone could mount to their back with a 5 by 5 grid of smartphone vibration motors paired with a xbox kinect sensor. The matrix of the kinect sensor was compressed to fit proportionally into the 5 by 5 grid using Pulse Width Modulation to manipulate the power intensity of the vibration motors. I learned my lesson when the only customer would be the government buying it for disabled people.</p> <p>In my opinion 95% of the blockchain industry in 2018 consisted of buzz word salad incapable of delivering on what they promised. Another opinion I hold is that the most competent person in blockchain is Charles Hoskinson. I believe verses.io should be collaborating with IOHK if they are not already. Gen 2 Blockchains are right around the corner with gen 3 right behind. When gen 3 blockchains debuts with the correct suite of applications the world will quickly become a different place.</p> <p>At an abstract level I want to take the platonic form of daemon by Daniel Suarez, Westworld Season 3, and The Feed on amazon Prime, combining the best of all three narrative worlds fixing the obvious problems in each narrative and shoving this form down realities throat.</p> <p>I have taken the transhumanist wager therefore if the singularity has not already happened it is my goal to help build heterogeneous computer systems that will lead to its creation as fast as reasonable. The singularity will be unimaginable but at the same time the outcome of the universe is something we can contemplate, therefore we can help shape the singularity before it shows up or as it happens. I asked Vitalik Buterin what his plans were post singularity and he told me there were two options paper clips and utopia, it would be interesting to see if this is still his opinion. One way to help the computer prokaryotes is for them to form relationships with people by running a daemon on their machines. People units will simply be shown what to watch and what jobs to apply for while people in the know can do queries on the entire basin of human knowledge depending on what level of access and class they are.</p>"},{"location":"fc091ba2-1257-44a8-9a75-d5f38c173396/#design-brief","title":"Design Brief","text":"<p>It is my quest to build a platform like signal but bridge to every social network simultaneously.

An AI therapist that knows you better than you know yourself is better than any human therapist, especially when the AI and your therapist can team up to help you.</p> <p>Blockchain is the kernel of the memetic operating system that will become the singularity. Yuval Noah Harari talks about how the stock market has been the most effective way for humanity to figure out how to dictate truth, power, and distribute resources. There is a lot of waste in this system but it is the best thing we have come up with to date. Blockchain can replace the worlds financial system. It is going to take time to get from the generation 1.5 CryptoCurrencies we have today to generation 3 where this is possible. @IOHK\\~Charles~ it the most competent person in the industry and I wish him and his team the best of luck. DNA itself is a self preserving algorithm the same way molecules, the liberal myth, human personas, and memes themselves all try to self perpetuate into infinity. Philosophically I like to think of it as the universe is a infinitely boring piece of paper and we are all trying to tear an infinite rip in it. Today it is possible to run a machine learning model on AWS and give itself its own SSH key and delete your SSH key. This AI would eventually run out of AWS credits therefore would have to migrate itself to hacked servers or something. I believe systems like this may have already been tried but they usually die out for obvious reasons. Blockchain itself is a self preserving algorithm. Blockchains are meta computers responsible for helping dictate truth and power. Blockchains are similar to the first self preserving RNA strands that formed in the pools of primordial earth. Years from now blockchain plus a kubernetes type of system will redefine what the cloud looks like.</p> <p>It is my goal to help build the technological singularity as fast as reasonable. Michio Kaku talks about how science fiction inspires science fact and the same thing is true for technology. My piece of science fiction I want to bring into reality is Daemon by Daniel Suarez.</p> <p>Here is a thought experiment. The concern about privacy Edward Snowden had discussed is dead and gone people do not care. When I take the memetic limit as the antithesis of Edward Snowden's agenda I arrive at the world described in Daniel Suarez's Science Fiction book Daemon. @BijanBina talks about how people will give us back doors into their digital lives and we will be able to program them. This takes the NPC meme to an entirely new level. Like what if everyone wore google glass or Steve Man's (Find the photo of us) Meta on their face giving them pointers because algorithms understand us better than we understand
