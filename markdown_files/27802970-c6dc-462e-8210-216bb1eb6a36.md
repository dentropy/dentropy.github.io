title: What is the name of the most active channel in each discord guild?
---
How do we do this while avoiding a loop?


``` SQL

select 
	channel_message_count_t.guild_id,
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	channel_message_count_t.channel_id,
	channels_t.channel_name,
	channel_message_count_t.message_count 
from (
	select guild_id, channel_id, COUNT(id) as message_count from messages_t
	group by guild_id, channel_id
) as channel_message_count_t
join (
	select distinct guild_id, max(message_count) max_messages from
	(
		select guild_id, channel_id, COUNT(id) as message_count from messages_t
		group by guild_id, channel_id
	) as count_channel_messages_t
	group by guild_id
) as channel_message_max_t on channel_message_max_t.max_messages = channel_message_count_t.message_count
join guilds_t on channel_message_count_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
join channels_t on channel_message_count_t.channel_id = channels_t.id;


```
