So I am currently reading the Dune prequels and it has some interesting takes on Basic Income. The world pre AI take over was fully automated luxury communism. Within this world a group of people grow resentful towards the state of humanity and its stagnation. Stagnation measured by the colonization of new planets or trying to really achieve anything. The revolutionaries hack the AI systems and install their own with human characteristics of ambition and survival. The AI system eventually locks the revolutionaries out of the system they created because they are wasting resources in a way with the old empire.
