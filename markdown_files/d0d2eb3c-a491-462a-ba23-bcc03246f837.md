#### TL;DR What Is Nostr?

Nostr is a decentralized [P2P](/eb562da3-447f-489a-a715-3cfcca10e8ec) social media protocol that used uses cryptography as a primitive rather than [DNS](/6f2b1d6c-3b38-4e05-bf02-69af4d23f098).

#### Getting Started with Nostr

Before developing on Nostr try out one of their clients from my [Nostr Client Reviews](/60856d0a-a8eb-49dd-ab2b-dd33d16ea527) document.

Once you have tried out raw Nostr check out a my [Notable Nostr Apps](/f5a7d558-219b-4d37-9e18-28f749488612) to see what can be built with Nostr.
