#### TODO

* Review existing Question Engine demo and schema
	* Find its requirements
* Tagging CID Schema for Datasets
* I can produce an analysis of a communities memes and attachments rather than their messages, I can do their messages after.
* I need website people can go to and demo
	* Actually I can just post the user name and password and then just go check the logs and stuff
* Start thinking of IPLD Schema to Dataframes, SQL, and Cypher
	* Well we just need a GraphQL binding for collections of JSON Schemas
	* That GraphQL Binding can have separate backends, just like [Langflow](/fb09a999-1293-4309-98dc-8f1bfa157f82) has different backend module requirement things
