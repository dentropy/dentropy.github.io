#### TODO

* [Epic User Journeys](/c81f0da9-8d82-4176-8458-cfb3d06924c4)
* We need to combine Nostr and CID's
* We need a token model for the QE prototype
	* We have the option of a MetaMask zK system, but that is far too complicated
	* We have the option of a cheap EVM chain but that is slow and shit, we need real time stuff
	* We have the idea where the issuer of the token maintains the head of the token, all signed as CID, Nostr like events
	* We need a data model to connect Nostr accounts and ENS stuff
		* I need to do my ENS investigation
		* [OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree: A JavaScript library to generate merkle trees and merkle proofs.](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree)
