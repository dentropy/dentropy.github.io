When thinking of institutional managed bitcoin where they do not want to move the bitcoin. We may want to have a way to stop BTC or UTXO's from being able to be spent to move themselves. Therefore requiring that someone pay the fee to transfer the BTC themselves and the institution can always have a hot wallet worth millions ready in case someone moves the funds.
