## Questions

* [How can I add/remove an owner to gnosis-safe wallet from solidity smart contract? - Ethereum Stack Exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/121798/how-can-i-add-remove-an-owner-to-gnosis-safe-wallet-from-solidity-smart-contract)
	* If you want smart contracts or other gnosis safe's to be able to count as a signature in the safe one will need to extend the gnosis safe with a module
	* The ability to have another smart contract count in the decision process complicates things quite a lot because gnosis safe checks for people agreeing with signatures rather than transactions done on chain to the contract
* Can you do off chain votes for token holders
	* Yes you can use [dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/SafeSnap](/dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/SafeSnap)
