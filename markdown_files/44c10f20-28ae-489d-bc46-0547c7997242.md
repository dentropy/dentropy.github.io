User Story Research

As a [user type] I want [action], so that [benefit / value].

So an example of this for hive might be:

"As a competitive gamer, I want to see leader-boards on tournament pages so that I can compare myself to others more easily."

I got a user story for the over arching goal, I just need to rephrase it for the more imediate goals.

Actually I have another human I am building for now rather than myself, they want human in the loop labeling of discord messages for use as a knowledge repository/wiki. I will also be grabbing metadata for YouTube videos posted on their discord server.

or

"As an event spectator, I want streams to be more easily accessible so I can watch my friends play in tournaments"

A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework. It’s an end goal, not a feature, expressed from the software user’s perspective.
