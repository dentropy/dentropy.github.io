* I should use a DAG tool like [Airflow](/496477c7-b5a5-4498-bc02-9e9ca5f473d1) or [Hamilton - Software](/a83ae1cd-71ba-4fe6-846f-2c169a802b9a)
* I should transform strait into [Postgres](/5d70cd64-3134-4b62-8879-12f1f8bb4afe) rather than having [sqlite](/1a1ccc57-1ba3-4ba7-8db9-9eb945b88d85) in the middle
	* Explain how SQLite in memory is so dam fast
* Putting the 10 million records strait into [Postgres](/5d70cd64-3134-4b62-8879-12f1f8bb4afe) on a [M1 Macbook Air](/undefined) takes longer than I would have expected, this experience has really shown me the value of something like Spark.
	* I had a way to do the SQLite transformation in memory which was much faster than default configuration Postgres
* Talk about wanting to grab data by guild, load into system, and do analytics. Never having everything in memory at the same time just like how CPU's have different levels of cache and the human brain can only really keep track of 7 things at once.
* Talk about the value on Interrogation
