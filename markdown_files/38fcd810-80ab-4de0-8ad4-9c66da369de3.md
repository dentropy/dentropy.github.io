title: DDaemon - Two Root Problems
---
I am interested in two problems. 

1. How does one put all data they have personally generated into an single accessible API with RBAC(Rule Based Access Control).
2. Once all one's data is all easily queryable what do you do with it?
	1. Ask yourself, what is Data For?
