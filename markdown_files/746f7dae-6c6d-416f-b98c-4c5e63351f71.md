How to slap yourself in the face.

My Zenu [Relationships.People.Charles Hoskinson](/Charles Hoskinson) likes to make a point about guide posts. Charles of course wanted our governments to choose some guide posts in order to have some coherent [wiki.concepts.list.Covid.Policy](/covid policy) but Guide Posts can apply to almost any thing. The guide posts I am interested in deconstructing how people expect to be treated verse how they want to be treated.
