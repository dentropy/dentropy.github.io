title: What is Question Engine?
---
TL;DR The sovereign Internet that is collectively annotable 

Life is primarily made up of two tasks, quests or goals, and the questions we ask in order to articulate these quests.

A composable medium for your data that should last the test of time.

Question Engine is the latest in a long line of [Hypermedia Projects](../17c98fae-689f-45d3-a2ee-6b1d29525f99). The basic idea is that **any media you can read, watch, or hear you can annotate on top of with context**. But context is more than just writing what you think of a particular piece of media. 

**Context curation is key**, just like a book is sorted in a way so the reader unfamiliar with it can make sense to it the context on top of media also needs to be sorted.
