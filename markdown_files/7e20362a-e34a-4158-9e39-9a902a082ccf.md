title: Obsidian Publish
---
* Just use [Obsidian Mkdocs Publisher](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher)
* [yoursamlan/pubsidian: An Obsidian-Publish alternative but it's FREE](https://github.com/yoursamlan/pubsidian)
	* Still need to try
* [jackyzha0/quartz: ðŸŒ± host your own second brain and digital garden for free](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
	* Tested and works but you need to fix all the markdown links somehow
	* Remember to add [dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Go](../dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/List/Go) path
	* Also remember to install hugo as a package
