title: QE Demo for Friends at Get Together
---
As the developer of Question Engine, I want to be able to do a demo for my friends on their phone, so I can get feedback in the wild.

#### User Journey

Hi my name is [dentropy](../afcfbf44-6a9d-44cc-b9ce-bdf2c9d8b346), I am working on a project called [Question Engine](../7d2a0ebd-d4d1-4d2f-83ea-d256dc589625) and I would like you to demo it for me.

Hi Dentropy I am [Randy](../bd56e2cf-3805-4ed5-982b-7a2162d05eda), what would you like me to do?

Alright randy I am going to [DM](../71b10480-9d7f-4358-80c2-eb119e3db4f0) you a link and then I will guide you from there.

Cool, send the link, says [Randy](../bd56e2cf-3805-4ed5-982b-7a2162d05eda)

[dentropy](../afcfbf44-6a9d-44cc-b9ce-bdf2c9d8b346) sends the link to the [IPFS](../e1636216-dee3-430e-949c-3b2c24c36701) hash for the frontend hosted on [Filebase](../d5f0f13e-5c6e-4019-b235-e7b316df6131)

Alright Randy, [dentropy](../afcfbf44-6a9d-44cc-b9ce-bdf2c9d8b346) says, once you open the link can  you read to me what it says in bold?

Randy replies, [Question Engine](../7d2a0ebd-d4d1-4d2f-83ea-d256dc589625) followed by [Wield a persona and articulate who you are](../fa44aa1e-1c2d-4504-a663-7381b694c638)

[dentropy](../afcfbf44-6a9d-44cc-b9ce-bdf2c9d8b346) say, cool it works not tell me what buttons do you see.

[Randy](../bd56e2cf-3805-4ed5-982b-7a2162d05eda) replies that they only see two buttons, [Wield New Persona](../Wield New Persona) and [Open QE Hub](../Open QE Hub)

Cool dentropy says, now select [Wield New Persona](../Wield New Persona) and tell me what you see.

Randy says, "I get this 'What is Question Engine'" thing,

Dentropy says, ah yes, let me explain it to you. [What is Question Engine?](../c9ad4625-84be-4210-967a-c45bb3ec11ce), [Question Engine is like twitter, reddit, and github had a federated encrypted baby with more gate keeping](../2423216e-93b9-497c-a5b1-6c318453cdc3).

Randy Says, What does that mean

Dentropy Says, as long as you have cool shit to say and can carry a conversation you will be fine.

Randy, alright, so my screen now says, this stuff about wielding my persona,

![wield_persona - Screen](../b3533689-04f1-4549-9dee-6def145cfcc2)

**Anecdote**
* The "What Is Question Engine" description can be a IPNS QE DAG-JSON event compatible with Nostr.
* Alternatively it can be a IPNS name.
* Shit I need to recompile Nostr events as DAG-JSON
	* Actually I just need a lookup table of existing events, everything can still be in S3, IndexedDB, or whatever
	* I can also have a list of CID events I have captured
* We need to have a CID lookup table that represents all of a users data
	* We need to come up with our own CID codes, like one for Nostr events, and others for DAG-JSON data types like meme, questions, and UUID-Lookup Tables


Dentropy, ya that's the tutorial, you can click next for now.

**Anecdote**
* Do we just mint the tokens for the first user with the rules explaining how it works?
* Yes that would be a good idea
* Just have a "Use Default Option" with 144 tokens that renew 6 every hour once the faucet is set
* On Question Engine context and attention are commodities therefore you need to setup a faucet hereby declaring `your attention has value`. For now you can just select "Use Default Faucet"
* "Use Default Faucet" verses "Customize Faucet Settings"


Randy asks, what is this faucet thing?

Dentropy answers, when people interact with you they are required to use your token. It is like Karma on reddit or likes on twitter but they actually mean something.

Randy says, that's pretty cool. What does that tangibly mean though?

Dentropy, you will see in a minute select "Use Default Faucet" for now.

Randy, sure I selected it. Now I got this popup that says,
Question Engine need some premises to get up and running, select "Curate Questions of Value" and below that is says, Go to QE Dashboard

Dentropy, select "Curate Questions of Value"

Randy, sure, the first question is 
[Have you watched any movies lately that you would recommend?](../Have you watched any movies lately that you would recommend?)
What do I do now?

Dentropy, Alright we are just trying to see what questions you care about, just swipe right if you find it interesting, and left if you don't, there is also a null button bottom middle. Do at least 5

Randy, sure

Randy answers 5 question

Randy, I got a new popup it says,

* Your Faucet is now live
* You can now engage with Questions
	* See Number of Public Answers
	* See Number of Partial Answers
	* See replies to Answers
* You can engage with Persona's
	* See Public Questions
	* See Public Answers
	* Request tokens
	* Use Faucet
* You can ask your own Questions and post your own memes
* You can now take `Quest Training` in order to define your first Quest

Randy, what is `Quest Training`?

Dentropy, well have you ever noticed how "[Quest](../fbf58632-0593-4291-8dca-a0b2e6841750)" is the root word for [Question](../31ebcbb3-2de1-4e48-bdae-aac01c14add4)?

Randy, no not that I think of it

Dentropy, well the goal of Question Engine is to encourage people to engage in meaningful enough conversation that one can get assigned a quest, one can assign themselves a quest or they can get help from someone else. A quest can be as simple as review someone's blog post or as complex as do a startup company. Question Engine is malleable and allows you to break down complex quests or integrate simple quests into bigger quests.

Randy, ah I got you. So this is yet another TODO app.

Dentropy, ya I guess except it is multiplayer.

Randy, so where do I go to attain a quest.
