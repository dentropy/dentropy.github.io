The goal of the dentropy daemon is to create a unified privacy oriented API for all data a individual generates.

## Context

I save my favourite Reddit posts when I should just be bookmarking and tagging them. I create playlists on youtube when I should be creating collections of tagged bookmarks. I like tweets when I should be tagging and webmarking them. I should now be able to use the same tags across all these platforms plus be able to interpolate across these links. I should also be able to semantically link any of these webmarks. Webmarks can also contain internal nodes.
