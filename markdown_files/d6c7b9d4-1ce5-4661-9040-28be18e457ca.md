title: Vision - DDaemon
---
The goal of the dentropy daemon is to create a unified privacy oriented API for all data a individual generates.

## Context

I save my favourite Reddit posts when I should just be bookmarking and tagging them. I create playlists on youtube when I should be creating collections of tagged bookmarks. I like tweets when I should be tagging and webmarking them. I should now be able to use the same tags across all these platforms plus be able to interpolate across these links. I should also be able to semantically link any of these webmarks. Webmarks can also contain internal nodes.


#### Brainstorming

* The third part of the daemon besides QE and CGFS is a zero knowledge system so people do not die with their informationÂ 
* Computers exist of three components
	* Pubsub - Nostr
	* Storage - S3/IPFS
	* Computer - Your Device or Daemon
* We can have a browser extension that supports
	* Nostr
	* PGP
	* Ethereum
	* Bitcoin / Lightning Bitcoin
	* Generate all accounts from a single mnemonic
	* And act as a self sovereign Nostr relay
	* We replace 3 of my favorite apps
		* Obsidian + Tiddlywiki
		* Raindrop + Hypothesis + Memex +[ArchiveBox](../405b67dc-be60-4211-ad64-9d65188fbef8)
		* ActivityWatch
	* Every Discord Guild is going to be a DuckDB database that can be loaded into a browser (or Daemon) to do analytics on
* Also if people want to use other blockchain keys on Nostr it is like PGP you sign the Nostr key with an expiration date, my nostr relay can do additional processing, everything stays backwards compatible
