## Remember [Logs - Searching Through Files Tutorial Research](/1fa45ca3-dc17-45e7-b4ce-d21c4ed08844)

Earlier today I realised that [vscode](/c5c6a1cd-41da-4b61-9292-0907087ef1ae) will only search through the contents of files I have open not all the files I have in the workspace, so I set out to resolve this issue.

[ripgrep](/ebb1ef96-28c0-4d20-a381-1e904cdcfb0e) is the best tool for the job and turns out [grep](/undefined) with the right flags works pretty well too. 

I want to be able to search for the same phrases being used in different files. This requires some text processing. Time to learn some [NLP](https://www.nlpdemystified.org/course/introduction).

I want to be able to get all domain names mentioned in a folder of markdown files.

I also want to be able to parse markdown files.

I want to extract all names mentioned in markdown files.

I want to extract all questions mentioned in markdown files.

I want to be able to easily parse and search PDF,DOCX and HTML files.

To be Continued....
