title: ETL to QE, Update 29, Tangible Competition
---
Hello World,

I have realized that there is something very important missing from my [QE Demo for Friends at Get Together](../ec5b995d-f5ce-4183-ae17-11efb114aef8) User Journey. The only way one can DM another person is to get the other person's public key, that's retarded.

I have done some research on [NIP-05](../40890ebc-0879-4fab-8c1d-c9a3e583aa74), Nostr DNS Identities, that solves this problem. They basically allow for the lookup of Nostr identities based on what looks like email addresses but really aren't, [their example docs](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) give "bob@bob.com" as an example.

In the [Nostr](../78abfe73-37cb-4f3b-9e08-faad85669fb7) ecosystem there are a series of [free and paid DNS identity providers](https://nostr.how/en/guides/get-verified). The paid DNS identity providers usually take [Bitcoin](../661f0e89-294a-4700-b640-2b11b5ed1f19) on the [Bitcoin Lightning Network](../75afb5eb-509b-4f13-8c36-39e20b9153f6) and also provide hosting for an additional cost.

My current roadmap basically involves writing a custom Nostr client that also has, 

* Composable data model
* IPNS/IPLD file system in [IndexedDB](../9fea8cfd-e8fa-4324-921c-e9455862e374)
* Peer to Peer [RBAC](../c2a97a91-e9a0-4b83-9b91-acae4ec52e73) file system
* [PKMS](../ea5dd34b-8140-436d-9106-1bea26a2b5d9) features
* Pseudonym Persona Management features
* E2EE using PGP rather than Bitcoin's Cryptographic Curve
* Focus on Peer to peer messaging using [NIP-16](../6db3c7aa-27b9-4be8-b386-d7087c712e05) ephemeral messages
* Crypto Currency Wallet

Those things are nice and all but no one will use it if you only message people based on public keys. So let's solve that problem first.

My goal for the [NIP-05](../40890ebc-0879-4fab-8c1d-c9a3e583aa74), Nostr DNS Identities, POC is to have 

1. Deploy a [Caddy](../eddb09d0-9b00-4d82-abfe-2ba84c188dfa) server on a VPS
	1. Caddy has a API to update settings, that's why I chose it over [nginx](../2c37e79d-9050-4762-8cc6-42f9060bd348) or anything else
2. Point DNS at it
3. Write scripts to add, remove, and update [NIP-05](../40890ebc-0879-4fab-8c1d-c9a3e583aa74), Nostr DNS Identities
4. Create a GUI with Nostr Authentication for managing the [NIP-05](../40890ebc-0879-4fab-8c1d-c9a3e583aa74), Nostr DNS Identities
5. Publish tutorials, project update, documentation, and code so far
6. Learn how to accept [Bitcoin Lightning Network](../75afb5eb-509b-4f13-8c36-39e20b9153f6) payments and write a tutorial
7. Review competing Nostr providers, share my thoughts with them
