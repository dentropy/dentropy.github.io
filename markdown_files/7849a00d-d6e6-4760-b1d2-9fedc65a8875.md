[stereum-dev/ethereum2-docker-compose: Run different kind of Ethereum 2 staking nodes with monitoring tools and own Ethereum 1 node out of the box!](https://github.com/stereum-dev/ethereum2-docker-compose)

Remember to include .env file --env-file ../../.env

When in doubt drop Grafana and prometheus

These write permission issues are killing me

``` bash
sudo docker logs stereum-geth-1 --follow
```
