title: Why am I building Question Engine?
---
I get a good feeling when someone asks me an interesting question. I hate it when I have an enlightening conversation with interesting questions and insights but can't remember the specifics of the conversation the next day. I often find bursts of inspiration that work for a time but then collapse when I become overwhelmed with complexity. I often find myself lost in life and feel if I had the right set of questions I could effectively orient myself. I hope to build Quest(ion) Engine so I can have an environment to get to know myself.
