## Me getting started

#### I need software to run my ship

[Releases · urbit/port](https://github.com/urbit/port/releases)


``` bash
# yay -S port # failed
yay -S port-bin
```

#### I need my special phrase

Got my management proxy and master ticket.

I need a key from [Bridge](https://bridge.urbit.org/)

Login, Select `OS` and click `Download Keyfile`

Put the keyfile somewhere so `port` can access it

#### Booting planet, I may need to factory reset on my shit cause I used it a long time ago

Waiting a couple minutes to boot.

* Now what do I want to do with my planet once I get it?
* Who do I want to get in contact with?
* What kind of people do I want to talk to?
* What kind of apps are there for me to run?
* What kind of video would I possibly want to record showcasing urbit?
* What is the urbit endgame?
* What does urbit offer that is not offered anywhere else?

#### Planet Economics

* A planet costs 3.5 Eth
  * [Urbit ID: Star - Collection | OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id-star-2)
  * [Urbit ID: Star - Collection | OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id-star)
  * A planet goes for 0.025 Eth
  * A star has 2^8 planets, that makes 256 planets
  * 0.025 * 256 = 6.4
  * Wow if you sell all your planets you can actually make money
