How can we use [Biscuit](/e92a03b3-9567-47a7-9c24-ce4ccb4119c6) with [DAG-JSON](/542cf224-0a5f-4c62-b4f8-41521da2dd50) [CID](/87e4fb9d-e5a8-4657-a7ba-f0962d1d075a)'s and [jsonschema](/ae47732c-10e8-4d3b-b365-9c3902febdfa) to create a decentralized version of [OAuth](/840bb155-6d8b-4e85-8740-c7b250fc7d65) integrated with blockchain signing systems that also works with [Nostr](/78abfe73-37cb-4f3b-9e08-faad85669fb7).

#### What Problem are we trying to solve?

When I was developing my [Question Engine POC V1](/Question Engine POC V1) had the following user flow,

* User wants to create account
* User goes to Question Engine website
* User selects create account
* Form pops up requiring user input a new username
* User fills in their desired user name
* User selects submit on form
* [MetaMask](/037fca47-315e-46e3-a9f0-fc5dbc3ca4ef) pops up requiring signature from user
* Signature and requested username are sent to server
* Validation occurs on server and cookies is generated and sent to be stored in client's browser
* User is now logged in
* User now attaches cookie to every request that requires authentication

Requiring MetaMask to sign every request sent to a Question Engine website is a bad user flow.
