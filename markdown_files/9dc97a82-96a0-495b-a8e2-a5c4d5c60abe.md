The same friend that recommended the [psycopg2](/undefined) optimizations in [ETL to Question Engine, Update 5](/88cd3a9e-9156-4482-aaa5-2bb8eeebca0d) mentioned that I was using my Postgres like MongoDB when I should be using proper native SQL. In this update I will defend my initial decision to use JSON tables and then circle back to why this design decision is not as optimal as I first expected and why JSON Files to Native SQL is the way to go.

JSON Files -> SQLite JSON Tables

JSON Files -> SQLite JSON Tables -> Native SQLite Tables -> CSV Tables -> Postgres Tables -> -> Concatenate Postgres Tables -> Cast Timestamps in Postgres Tables  -> Any desired format

JSON Files -> JSON Postgres SQL Tables -> Native Postgres SQL Tables -> Any desired format

JSON Files -> Native Postgres SQL Tables -> Any desired format

[DuckDB](/undefined) and its [Postgres](/5d70cd64-3134-4b62-8879-12f1f8bb4afe) plugin have got me thinking
