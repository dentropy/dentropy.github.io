title: Gauging Blockchain Understanding
---
The goal of this document is to build a map of the concepts required to understand blockchain technology. Blockchain is a complicated technology that can be understood at many different levels. By now most people have heard of bitcoin and simply think of it as magic internet money but many of those same people have never heard of the concept of blockchain. Blockchain is not bitcoin and understanding the difference can be pretty difficult.
