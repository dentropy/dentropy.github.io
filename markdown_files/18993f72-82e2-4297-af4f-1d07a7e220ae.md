Randy sees four tabs "Context Feed", "Quest(ion) Log", "Discovery", and "Your Persona"
* Randy sees that the "Quest(ion) Log" tab is selected
* Randy reads, 
	* ## Quest(ion) Log No Logs Description

* Randy selects the "Discovery" tab but does not see any users.
	* ## No Public Users Message

There are no public users yet, that doesn't mean there is nobody here though. Someone set this app up after all. Please go to the "Profile" tab add yourself a little description and start asking questions.

## Discovery Screen Example Table

* Randy selects the "Your Persona" tab. 
* Randy sees the tab change and sees a popup.
	* ## Popup Contents

TL;DR: Just click "Mint yourself 12 Tokens by clicking here" to get started on your first Q&A

Hi Pseudonym, glad to see you using Quest(ion) Engine. We see your wallet of Pseudonym's QP's are empty. No need for alarm, you can mint some yourself. These tokens have your name on them because they are under your sovereign control. [Your life has value](https://youtu.be/MRuS3dxKK9U?t=63) after all. After you have claimed your tokens you can use them to in Q&A's.

Button: Mint yourself 12 of Pseudonm's QP by clicking here

P.S. QP stands for "Quest(ion) Point's" by the way.
