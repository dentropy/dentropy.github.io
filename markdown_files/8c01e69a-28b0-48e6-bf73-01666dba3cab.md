* CAP Theorem
  * Consistency: Every read from the database gets the latest (and correct) piece of data or an error
  * Availability: Every request is received and a response is given -- without a guarantee that the data is the latest update
  * Partition Tolerance: The system continues to work regardless of losing network connectivity between nodes
You can only have Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP) or Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP).
