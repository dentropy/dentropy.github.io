## Feedback, or lack there of, is as Valuble as Gold

Today I published my discord analytics report, which can be found [here](https://mediagoblin.newatlantis.top/u/user/m/dataframetograph20231018/), on a couple of the discord guilds I scraped and discovered no one cared. I got legit zero response. This is partly because of the message I posted but also because I did not write for the community. 

The message simply said, "I think this graph of which DAO Discord Guilds are the most active by month is pretty interesting" followed by this graph,

This lack of response was very disheartening and my initial reaction was to hide away rather than continue to engage. I am realizing I have a serious problem [spending too much time in my head](../d76080e1-816c-4fa9-a0b7-93c6096e4227). I think these social media engagement graphs are very interesting, I have put a lot of time and effort into them. I finally have a product I can show off to the people I got the data from.

Now that I think about it I have not really personally engaged with any of these discord servers. I have not really spent any time trying to get to know what each community is trying to accomplish. I have not spent time getting to know a single person from these communities. I have not put in an hour to just read different channels and write summaries about them. This needs to change is this project is ever going to be successful.
