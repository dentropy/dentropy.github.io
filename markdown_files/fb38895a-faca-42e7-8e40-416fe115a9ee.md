To get total number of users check out [What discord guild's have the most Users?](/a1f0f53d-327b-4999-9d06-81d2c14a5eb5)

To get percentage we need to join these queries

## Join sum of users with sum of users with less messages

``` SQL

SELECT * FROM 
(
	select 
		guild_message_count_t.guild_id as guild_id,
		guilds_t.guild_name,
		count(*) as users_more_10_messages
	from

					guild_id,
					author,
					count(content) as msg_count
				from messages_t
				group by guild_id, author 
			) as raw_author_message_count
		where msg_count > 20
	) as guild_message_count_t
	join guilds_t on guild_message_count_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
	group by guild_message_count_t.guild_id, guilds_t.guild_name
) as author_messages_threshold_t 
JOIN 
(
	select
