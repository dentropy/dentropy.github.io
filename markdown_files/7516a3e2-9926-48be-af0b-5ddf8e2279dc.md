	* Whahahaha
* LNBits Onboarding is Amazing
* Where is the universal javascript library for all major blockchains?
	* UTXO verse Account based transactions require an API
* Blockchain accounts and PGP keys fit into DIDs, also multicodec is an option but that can be embedded in the did format

Hi [Bryan Peters](../Bryan Peters) ,

I want you help walking through a train of thought,

One of the premises that Farcaster makes is the requirement of a custom [ID registry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TVI2uKgHtY), just like [urbit's Azumuth](https://github.com/urbit/azimuth/blob/master/contracts/Azimuth.sol), both of which technically have the same functionality as [ENS](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/registry/ENS.sol) and therefore don't "really" need to exist. Also did you know [Rootstock forked ENS](https://dev.rootstock.io/rif/rns/) and deployed it on their chain as well?

What if rather than relying on some identity standard to bootstrap new social media we just rely on raw public keys having the transaction history on public blockchains stand for itself. 

For example what if a Bitcoin address that once owned 32 Bitcoins back in 2014 but is now empty started signing messages, people would probably listen. Or what if one of the addresses that minted one of the first 100 ENS domains but is now empty starts having things to say. The identities of people would transform from raw pseudonyms to accounts with a story, that can also have a pseudonym.

One interesting thing you can do with a system like this is have reply threads/email chains where all these keys from the abyss sign one anothers messages resulting in a accumulated value amount that the signature chain once held.

Does something like this sound like it is worth buidling?

#### Old Plan

2. Clear Goals
   * Use algorithms to enhance human agency
   * Synthasize our wills with AI
      * Share our bodies with AI
   * Systemd for the human experience
3. A concise summary
   * Systems and algorithms will understand us better than we understand ourselves
4. Data Transparency
5. Qualitative Data
   * Data without context isn’t a white paper, it’s a spreadsheet. Consider interviewing thought leaders in your industry to get their opinions on the topic that you’re writing about.
6. Logical Flow
7. Data Visualization
8. The "Why" Element
9. A Launch Plan
