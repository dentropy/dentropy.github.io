## TODO

* Fix Authors T
* [Load SQLite databases into Postgres](/undefined)

Seems like we may need to fix the Export Procedure.

Indexes in author_t should reference guild
Primary Key for author_t should reference guild as well as author_id
We should have a simple_authors_t that has the unique authors and another for the authors with metadata
We need a script to import multiple sqlite files and put the real database data into temporary tables

``` sql
ALTER TABLE messages_t
  ADD CONSTRAINT message_id_to_author_id
  FOREIGN KEY (author)
  REFERENCES authors_t(author_id)
  ON DELETE CASCADE;
CREATE INDEX ON messages_t(author);
