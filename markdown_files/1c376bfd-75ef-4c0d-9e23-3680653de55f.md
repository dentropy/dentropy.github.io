## Description

Take data exported from discord guilds via [DiscordChatExporter](../96e29692-2bcb-48eb-90fd-3cd8fdd986c3) then transform it into a [Postgres](../5d70cd64-3134-4b62-8879-12f1f8bb4afe) database, with separate tables for guilds, channels, messages, authors, reactions, attachments, roles, and mentions in order to make analysis of data easier. I am going to develop tooling to generate ad curate context for Discord Guilds.

## Motivation

I personally find it difficult to navigate all discord guilds given how much notice there is. I am just thrown in channels. 

If I am going to look through the archive of a Discord Guild I want to know who can be my guide, there is a query for that. If I am searching for an answer for a specific topics within a discord guild I want powerful search with embeddings in a vector database, named entity recognition, and semantic search.
