title: If I control my planet in bridge with a Hardware Wallet and I lose my
  master ticket can I regenerate it?
---
## Answer

Azimuth has 5 separate public keys that are set. The Ownership address is set to the address inside your hardware wallet. If you rekey the master key you will


## Answering
I logged into bridge with my Ethereum Wallet and learned I can transfer my master ticket. This text was pulled from bridge UI

``` text
Reticketing is the process of generating a completely fresh wallet and transferring ownership of your point to that wallet.

Beware, this resets your proxy addresses; if you're using smart contracts, this might break them! It will also change your networking keys!
```

This rekey's the entire planet, let's find what this does in the smart contracts. Let's find what the code is doing

``` javascript
  // configure management proxy

  const managementTx = azimuth.ecliptic.setManagementProxy(
    contracts,
    point,
    toWallet.management.keys.address
  );
  managementTx.gas = GAS_LIMITS.SET_PROXY;

  // set spawn & voting proxies situationally

  // skip this step if reticketing an L1 point with L2-migrated spawn proxy
  let txs = [transferTmpTx, keysTx, managementTx];
  if (!isPlanet(point) && doSetSpawnProxy) {
    const spawnTx = azimuth.ecliptic.setSpawnProxy(

  transferFinalTx.gas = GAS_LIMITS.TRANSFER;

```

Seems like 3 transactions here

#### Why did we get 4 transactions?

transferPoint is called twice, I wonder if we actually needed to call it?

``` javascript
  //TODO no harm done if we already owned it, but should still get a bool arg
  //     for skipping this, if it isn't too big a burden for callers
  const transferTmpTx = azimuth.ecliptic.transferPoint(
    contracts,
    point,
    fromWallet.address,
    false
  );
  transferTmpTx.gas = GAS_LIMITS.TRANSFER;

  ...
  // transfer configured point to user's new wallet

  const transferFinalTx = azimuth.ecliptic.transferPoint(
    contracts,
    point,
    toWallet.ownership.keys.address,
    false
  );
  transferFinalTx.gas = GAS_LIMITS.TRANSFER;
  txs.push(transferFinalTx);

  //
  // finalizing & signing transactions
  //
```

What is this fromWallet and toWallet?

          fromWalletType: walletType,
          fromWalletHdPath: walletHdPath,

          txnSender,
        });
      }
    } catch (err) {
      console.error(err);
      setGeneralError(err);
```

I just went and generated the public key from the Management Proxy, that is the management address

You can use this script with **ethers@5.3** to generate the address

``` js
const ethers = require('ethers');

async function main() {
  // Load the mnemonic from the .env file
  let mnemonic = "MNEMONIC GOES HERE"
  let mnemonic_path = process.env.MNEMONIC_PATH
  if (mnemonic_path == ''){
    mnemonic_path = "m/44'/60'/0'/0"
  }
  if (!mnemonic) {
    throw new Error('MNEMONIC not found in .env file');
  }

  const wallet = ethers.Wallet.fromMnemonic(mnemonic, mnemonic_path);
  console.log('Wallet address:', wallet.address);
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Alright so why do we have a MASTER TICKET and a MANAGEMENT PROXY

I just realized that the [ethereum](../76ac962e-ea08-4b00-95e7-aa798b16a502) is inside both the MASTER TICKET and MANAGEMENT PROXY

It is pretty clear what transactions in the Bridge code set the Master Ticket and Management Ticket, 

It appears I can change ownership and management keys without having to reset network keys, interesting.

What does this `azimuth.ecliptic.setSpawnProxy` do

Gotta check azimuth-js

[Code search results](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aurbit%2Fazimuth-js%20setSpawnProxy&type=code)

Seems that setSpawnProxy just calls the smart contract, let's take a look at the source code

![Urbit HD Wallet](https://media.urbit.org/fora/proposals/UP-8.jpg)
Source: [Urbit HD Wallet • Reference • developers.urbit.org](https://developers.urbit.org/reference/azimuth/hd-wallet)

There are 5 Wallets, now why do we 5 keys.

Owner, Transfer, Spawn, Management, Voting

I feel like we only need

Owner, Management, and Voting

I reset my master ticket, so that reset everything

Ownership and Management are the only keys accessible from Bridge

So what does this Transfer key do, what does this Voting key do, what does this Spawn key do?

Wait so how do I reset networking keys?

* `azimuth.ecliptic.configureKeys` is used to set network keys

Oh SPAWN is used to MOONS

So what is the difference between MANAGEMENT and TRANSFER

You want a backup key, if OWNERSHIP seed is lost TRANSFER seed can allow the point to be reset. THE OWNERSHIP seed can CHANGE the TRANSFER address but not vice versa.

Okay I understand the 5 different keys now

2023-07-15T02:09:42-04:00

So Tlon, why does bridge set the spawn address when we are not going to be generating any moons any time soon!?!?!?!

Wait what is the Spawn address actually set to?
