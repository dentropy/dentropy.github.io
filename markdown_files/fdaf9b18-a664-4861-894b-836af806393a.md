title: How to view a discord message in context?

## SQL Query

Requires, message id, msg_timestamp, and channel_id of specific message

``` SQL

select * from
(
	select 
		*
	from
		messages_t
	where 
		channel_id = (select channel_id from messages_t offset 10 limit 1)
		and msg_timestamp > (select msg_timestamp from messages_t offset 10 limit 1)
	limit 5
)
union
select * from
(
	select 
		*
	from
		messages_t
	where 
		channel_id = (select channel_id from messages_t offset 10 limit 1)
		and msg_timestamp < (select msg_timestamp from messages_t offset 10 limit 1)
	limit 5
) order by msg_timestamp desc

```

## Scratch pad

* Plan 1
	* We feed in a single message_id
	* We then lookup the channel_id for that message_id
	* Then we sort all the messages from that channel
	* Then we pull out X messages before and after
* How do we pull out the messages before and after?
* Is there a feature in SQL for this, get before and after a specific ID?
	* ChatGPT says to use Union, [GET Rows Before/After ID](https://chat.openai.com/share/79667a77-b98d-4e21-a6e9-d25609f21414)
* Plan 2
	* There is a better way to do this
	* We get the timestamp from the specific_msg_id
	* Then we get 10 messages going backwards in time and 10 messages going forwards through time
	* Oh shit that is way better
* Plan 3
	* It is way easier to get the 10 messages after and the 10 messages before?
	* Wait I can join queries with limits
	* Yes but in order to do what we need the msg_timestamp, id, and channel_id
	* If you have a message you already have that info
	* Oh yad
## Rejected SQL Query from Plan 1


``` SQL

select
	*
from
(
	select 
		id as specific_msg_id,
		channel_id as specific_channel_id,
		msg_timestamp as specific_msg_timestamp
	from
		messages_t
	where id = (select id from messages_t offset 10 limit 1)
) as channel_metadata_t
join messages_t on channel_metadata_t.channel_id = messages_t.channel_id
order by msg_timestamp desc;

```
