title: Graph Database
---
Graph databases are viewed in contrast to Relational Databases that use [SQL](/9bf437f1-b997-4df7-9cb5-d1dcb65fb892) which are like spreadsheets. Spreadsheets and SQL think in terms of row's and columns while graph databases think in terms of nodes and edges. Nodes are actual things like people, places, and things and the edges are the relationships between them. Any two nodes can be connected via an edge and an edge can contain data such as a label. [neo4j](/aedf2ab7-cdca-471a-805f-387263af6292) uses a query language called [cypher](/6cae1c13-b46d-40a2-9f7d-91bfef18bdff) instead of [SQL](/9bf437f1-b997-4df7-9cb5-d1dcb65fb892) which is used by relational databases.
