Linkedin has 3 separate entities I want to scrape
* profiles
* companies
* jobs



## Tooling
* [joeyism/linkedin\_scraper: A library that scrapes Linkedin for user data](https://github.com/joeyism/linkedin_scraper)
	* Not all of it works but some of it does
	* Some of it works but not all of it
* [VishwaGauravIn/linkedin-jobs-api: ðŸ”¥Advanced node.js package for getting job listings from LinkedIn ðŸ’¼](https://github.com/VishwaGauravIn/linkedin-jobs-api)
	* Tested and works
	* This works, but only does job, I also want to know about companies
