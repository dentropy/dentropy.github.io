* I have realized that GraphQL is not really going to solve my problems [postgraphile](/314a79d7-8c7a-4b68-9f5d-eb161de21e8a) just has a cute interface for generating queries, sadly [GraphQL](/17962dab-f88d-4746-b8d7-74dcb179d791) can not do all my Queries.
	* [Should I use GraphQL?](/undefined)
* [How to solve RClone S3 Storage is not working as expected bug when backing up Discord Data?](/undefined)
* I need to setup dedicated infrastructure for this problem
	* I can use my Archive Server running TrueNAS Scale to backup all the raw scraped data and mount the data itself as a network mount, skip use of S3 for now
		* Turns out [TrueNAS Scale](/1fc6c96f-fcb0-40d9-9b57-0645b09dbc92) has a native [S3](/cc64a399-1cbe-44ee-ab4a-f36343a593ff) service
	* Scraping should write directly to network mount on TrueNAS Scale Server
		* [Zimaboard](/undefined)
		* [Dell Optiplex Micro](/undefined)
	* 500Gb SSD for Postgres on [Dell Optiplex Micro](/undefined)
* I need a TrueNAS Scale Cheatsheet and or Tutorial of my own
* Heat maps using calmap
