title: What is the activity of each month for each guild normalized on a single graph?
---
See [What is the activity per month of each discord guild measured in messages per month?](/edb39918-b02f-4ee7-b2b2-d902c8370412) for query

Noramlizing this data on a pure guild basis. Do I loop or can Pandas do this for me? Do we separate into separate dataframes or keep as a single one?

What is the question we ask ChatGPT?

I have a pandas dataframe with three columns label, month_timestamp, and value. I want to normalize the data for each label independently across all values and their associated timestamp. This means the values from separate labels do not relate to one another and do not effect the noralization. Please normalize between 0 and 100.
