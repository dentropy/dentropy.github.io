* Independent Data Marts
  * Departments have separate ETL processes & dimensional models
  * These separate dimensional models are called “Data Marts”
  * Different fact tables for the same events, no conformed dimensions
  * Uncoordinated efforts can lead to inconsistent views
  * Despite awareness of the emergence of this architecture from departmental autonomy, it is generally discouraged
