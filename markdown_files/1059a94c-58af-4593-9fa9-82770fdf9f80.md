* Docker [nginx-proxy-manager](../5c347a60-b0fd-4797-993a-c0a6f0943dc9) into [Wireguard](../b04649d5-c9c1-4d05-bf04-15db21b3d393) container into [OpenWRT](../aaa6f541-e5eb-4f8c-997b-2d185fcccf06)
* We should just update [Concepts/List/Dentropy Cloud](../Concepts/List/Dentropy Cloud) to support this
* **REMEMBER YOU NEED A ROUTE GOING BOTH WAYS**

``` bash
ssh -L 8081:localhost:81 root@
```

## TODO

* Write tutorial based on, 
	* [networking - Cannot get IP forwarding work in docker container - Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/743772/cannot-get-ip-forwarding-work-in-docker-container)
* Generate a Draw.io Diagram
* We can append nginx-proxy-manager to have the route to the wireguard container, maybe even go through a middle container
* We then need a client proxy
* Tor and I2P time

	* If I add a route to the wireguard server, and nginx proxy manager, we should be fine right?

## Logs

* 2023-07-14T21:26:34-04:00
	* Alright so what is the plan now?
* 2023-07-14T21:09:45-04:00
	* Nginx proxy manager is not meant to run outside docker
	* One builds on Debian the other Alpine, so it is hard to merge them
	* Can we create our own router in the middle
	* Ya but how do we save the state of the routes?
	* Maybe the 10.42.0.0 network just needed a route to and from
	* No that's stupid
	* Imagine every app having a docker container that forwards traffic
	* Dude you are basically developing your own Kubernetes at that point
	* Would it be better to have a client docker container
	* Then we can do app segmentation per wireguard, much more secure
	* So how would that work
	* Dude we still don't know how to forward the traffic
	* Dude we just need to build the nginx-proxy-manager with a route, or add it in
	* Ya we need a dam router inside of docker
	* Dude this was supposed to be simple
	* Alright let's find someone else that did it
* 2023-07-14T20:55:44-04:00
	* So what should the solution be?
	* Can we install nginx-proxy-manager with wireguard in a single container
	* That would be the perfect solution
	* Or you know, install this shit manually
	* Fuck that
	* I think I just static routed myself out of connecting to my own router
	* Yup
* 2023-07-14T20:42:16-04:00
	* Dude you should have described what you were going to do before you did it
	* How exactly does nginx proxy manager proxy manager forward to wireguard
	* Well maybe I need those from the wireguard IP's on the docker network as well
	* No you don't
	* So you forward traffic to the Wireguard instance, what does it do with that traffic?
	* Also why is all my traffic going out through the VPN?
	* Probably something to do with the firewall
	* Maybe you should add some static routes
	* Sure let's test that
* 2023-07-14T18:32:14-04:00
	* Alright what's next?
	* We test the wireguard connection
	* What about the proxy config thing
	* We also set that up
* 2023-07-14T18:17:01-04:00
	* Looking at Dentropy Cloud it appears that we already have the apps required
	* Got a VPS running Debian 11 and 500 MB of Ram
	* Default Debian
		* 90Mb
	* Docker Nginx Proxy Manager
		* 200Mb
	* Plus Wireguard
		* 250Mb
