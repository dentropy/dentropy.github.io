title: What is the rate of new users joining the specific discord guild per month?
---
## Notes

We can assume whenever the first message is sent it counts as a new user.

The rate of new users has to be measured by a gap of time, let's use Month

## Query Name

guild_new_author_per_month

## SQL

``` SQL


select
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	count(guilds_t.guild_name) as author_count,
	TO_TIMESTAMP(min_month_timestamp, 'YYYY-MM') as month_timestamp,
	earliest_author_message.guild_id
from
(
	select
		distinct 
			guild_id,
			author_guild_id,
			TO_CHAR(    min(msg_timestamp), 'YYYY-MM') as min_month_timestamp
	from
		messages_t
	-- where guild_id = '{}'
	group by guild_id, author_guild_id
) as earliest_author_message
join guilds_t on earliest_author_message.guild_id = guilds_t.id
group by earliest_author_message.guild_id, guilds_t.id, min_month_timestamp
order by month_timestamp asc;


```
