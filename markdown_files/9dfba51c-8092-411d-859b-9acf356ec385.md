title: The 4 Step plan for Question Engine
---
I have a four step plan to make this vision of commoditized context come true,

## 1. Discord Analytics Reports and Dashboard

* [Discord Binding](../1c376bfd-75ef-4c0d-9e23-3680653de55f)

## 2. Graph based Annotation on top of Discord Data

* Label where I want to exchange value
* Highlight high agency individuals explicitly with custom human and LLM descriptions
* Topic Modelling with results stored in Graph Database
## 3. Generalize Annotation DDaemon Style

* Keybase Data
* [Raindrop.io](../10a39cee-adc7-43fc-bd29-28256e1a6144) annotation
* Youtube Playlists Annotation
* Reddit Saved + Subreddits Annotation
* Activity Watcher + Browsing History
* Linkedin Connections

## 4. Proof of Meme Micro bounty Platform

* Turn the namespace of all questions, grammatical or not, into a mineable resource claimable by cryptographic identities
