title: What is ETL to Question Engine?

## What is ETL to Question Engine?

Question Engine is the name I use for the software toolbox I hope to eventually write that will be able to answer these questions.

I came up with the name Question Engine because I realized that having data sitting inside a database is useless unless you can poke and prod it with questions. The Questions one asks can can be broken down into simpler questions that all need to linked together. I think of this linking together of data, generating context, as mimetic sewing. I want a tool so I can perform mimetic sewing on not only my data but my friends, family, coworkers, and community.
