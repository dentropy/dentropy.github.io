# Dashboards #

Currently, the **Dentropy Dashboards** page only contains tools for data interaction, visualization, and export related to the **[Keybase-Binding](https://wiki.dentropydaemon.io/dentropydaemon/social-media-singularity/bindings/keybase)** project. This may change in the future as the scope of the project and associated tools grows. 

## Working Objective ##
To understand the objective motivating of any of these works, see the explanation **[here](https://wiki.dentropydaemon.io/en/dentropydaemon/semantic-forum)**.

  + See **[requests](/undefined)** from **[Keybase-Binding](https://wiki.dentropydaemon.io/dentropydaemon/social-media-singularity/bindings/keybase)** team.
  
> Current status: working on deploying tools to facilitate shared remote development.

### Social Media ###
To date, a lot of the project revolves around scraping text data and linking it up in a graph structure for visualization. Open questions include:
* ***Can we build a model and API that helps mediate events such as the **[Complexity Weekend](https://www.ComplexityWeekend.com)** hackathons?***
  + *By providing real-time actionable insight to event facilitators and organizers?*
  + *By suggesting emerging shared ontologies during interdisciplinary discussions?*
  + *By providing a feedback interface for community-driven value-state assignment?*
  + *By indicating the emergence of **Surprise** or other graph-defined endpoints indicating that interesting conversation is happening in a particular locale (channel).*
* ***Can we build a tool that facilitates communication by helping us write more effectively?***

#### [kumu.io](https://kumu.io) ####
> **[kumo](https://kumu.io)** is a promising platform that allows us to interface most of the data we have scraped from various pipelines to an interactive public-facing visual tool that promotes exploration and curation for "Human-in-the-Loop" analyses. Importantly, it updates dynamically via link to a Google `Sheets` table or a `json` object hosted elsewhere, and allows the user to export the data as `json` or `spreadsheet` if they would like a copy.

* [ideas](https://m053m716.kumu.io/ideas)
	+ Presentation with some indication of how text channel data could be used to "hook up" emergent ideas and trends using text channel interactions observed over the course of a weekend Hackathon event.

#### [github.com](https://github.com) ####
> Most of the current code is hosted on the private Keybase team repository (2020-11-06).

* [Max's Github Pages site](https://m053m716.github.io)
  + Miscellaneous data visualization embeddings.
* [Max's public code repos](https://github.com/m053m716?tab=repositories)
  + Miscellaneous code, some of which might be useful in text analyses.
