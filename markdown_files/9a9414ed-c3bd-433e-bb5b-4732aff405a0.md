title: What is the average message count for most active X days of a Discord Guild?
---
It is not fail to calculate the average message count per day of a Guild, we should do average of the most active 30 days

[How to get message count by day for a single discord guild?](/fe3d485e-3f96-4cbd-8a63-2feda6021e8e)

**See comment set_day_limit to update how many days average message count is calculated for**

``` SQL

select 
	guilds_t.id,
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	avg_msg_count,
	total_num_days
from (
	select 
		msg_count_per_day_t.guild_id,
		avg(msg_count_per_day_t.msg_count) as avg_msg_count,
		max(month_timestamp) - min(month_timestamp) as total_num_days
	FROM
	(
		select distinct 
			month_messages_t.guild_id as guild_id, 
			month_timestamp, 
			msg_count
		from (
			select
				distinct DATE_TRUNC('day', real_timestamp)
					         AS  month_timestamp,
			    COUNT(guild_id) AS msg_count,
			    guild_id 
			FROM messages_t
			WHERE messages_t.guild_id = (SELECT id from guilds_t LIMIT 1 offset 3)
			GROUP BY guild_id, month_timestamp
		) as month_messages_t
		order by msg_count desc
		limit 30 -- set_day_limit
	) as msg_count_per_day_t
	group by guild_id
) as msg_count_per_day_t
join guilds_t on msg_count_per_day_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id ;

```
