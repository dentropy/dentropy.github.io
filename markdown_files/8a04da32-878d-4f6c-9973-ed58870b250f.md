## Time Queries

Many of the Queries I do inside [DiscordAnalytics.py](https://github.com/dentropy/discord-export-to-sql/blob/main/DiscordAnalytics.py) take over a minute to perform on my 26 million message dataset running on dual core sever with 8Gb ram. I wanted to know which queries were taking the longest and needed to be optimized so within the DataAnalytics class I created an additional attribute that contained a DataFrame to store how long each query took in seconds.
