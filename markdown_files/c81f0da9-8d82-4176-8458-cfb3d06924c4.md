#### User Stories

We gotta use the daemon to produce a bunch of responses to someone on social media then have another personality or prompt judge them

As a individual who is lost, I want a tool to help me find a community I belong in, so that I can make lifelong friendships

Write about how people don't want to be the protagonist in their own life, like that episode of [Darker than Black](../Darker than Black) when the rich lady needs to have someone of power live through her. People do the same in romantic relationships, in the corporate world, and even in stuff as simple as group projects.

Remember user journey of everything in life on a timeline like music

User journey for clustering vectors, even calculating a vector for a series of embeddings

The lifestyles of people will have to be designed by a new type of aristocrat, remember my new religion

I need to focus on writing grants, bro that is where QE comes in

Rather than only fans only quests
Danny said that that sounds like something the ancient Greeks would use

Each of the tech I posted about in the ddaemon tech stack needs user stories and user journeys

Make sure you have tied your shoes before you do your startup, or the laces will fray with technical debt 

What would it take me to respond to every tweet I read, well the good ones I usually like or bookmark at least, I need to describe the prompts that get me to run that persona

As someone who enjoys dinner parties, I want to make friends with people who host dinner parties, so I can go to more dinner parties

As someone who engages in group chats I want to go back and privately annotate what we were talking about

As someone who bookmarks too ich shit I want to share my tagged bookmarks with others so I know what links are actually useful 

As someone who tags all their bookmarks I want to be able to share all bookmarks with a specific tag with my friends sorted using an integer value 

If you keep talking about a tool to think through come up with all the thinking you want to do as user stories and journeys   

Make a list of engagement places, list where you are engaging, then list ways to engage decision sieve style

This is what Question Engine is all about. Training Suits to be tech bros.
