## Wrote an ETL Class

[Direct Link to Python File](https://github.com/dentropy/discord-export-to-sql/blob/main/ETLFunctions.py)

commit: 657cb36b6ab06b3be9860d3753258ba2fa2c123e

My [run_dag.py file](https://github.com/dentropy/discord-export-to-sql/commit/a300af03055f36b5af1e92b2061cd43fc9415265) was much more verbose than it needed to be. For example it all the functions inside [ETLFunctions.py](https://github.com/dentropy/discord-export-to-sql/blob/main/ETLFunctions.py)were separately inside [run_dag.py](https://github.com/dentropy/discord-export-to-sql/commit/a300af03055f36b5af1e92b2061cd43fc9415265) as well as manually configuring logging resulting in 167 lines of code. I took all those functions and logging and turned it into a class which results in [run_dag.py] being reduced to 23 lines and being much more readable.
