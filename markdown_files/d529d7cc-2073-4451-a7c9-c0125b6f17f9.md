## Extended Outline

* Abstract
* Historical Background
	* Talk about how the world we live in is the result of an old antiquated vision
		* [An Open Conspiracy](/a532d417-d6c1-4af0-a2cf-3b33ee4f9a67)
	* Play off the idea that the world only allows for the playing of a single game when we could be playing multiple games
	* Talk about the move from unipolar to multi polar world
		* [Peter Zeihan](/undefined), [The End of the World Is Just the Beginning](/undefined)
* The World we Currently Live In
	* Failed Networked and Crypto Dreams
	* Ideology is evolving and we lost the grip on the stories we tell ourselves
	* We are losing our ability to productively communicate
* A Game to Design The Human Experience
	* Society is a Game of Games
	* Our institutions function as a game where the results are decisions
	* Different Games different Rules Same Nature
		* [Thomas Sowell](/undefined), [Constrained verses Open Vision](/undefined)
* Vision for the Realm Token
	* Imagine the [Game Seed](/undefined) from [Sword Art Online](/undefined) but integrates with the real world
		* The vast number of media, especially anime, where people get reincarnated in video game worlds make me think that people want the real world to operate more like a game
	* [Question Engine](/cc5cc49d-f554-4f29-b31a-b8789688e6a3)
		* Modular Social Media Components, server as as well as client
		* Better note taking than your favourite [KMS - Knowledge Management Systems](/6aef6fe9-4c4e-4f3a-850c-e163e2303f81) software
	* [Appcoins](/undefined) like Marketplace with better metadata because integrated feedback via Question Engine
		* Additionally require realm token staking to list apps and get approved
	* [AWS Mechanical Turk](/undefined) but on the blockchain managed via a reputation system and decentralzied real time market makers
	* Quest Engine, Bounty Platform
		* The communication patters on sites like Gitcoin and Upwork are intimidating to many folks.
		* What if we rewarded people for simply creating quests that had real world value, such as developing a SQL Tutorial for your friends to take, making gardening videos based on a tutorial you found online, or listening to a stranger online who really wants to rant about their favourite book
			* Note that each of these tasks requires people to actually interact with one another rather than retreating into their own "realm"
	* Oracle System like [Chainlink](/undefined) or [Augar](/undefined) but with more data throughput because running on Urbit rather than blockchain native
	* Develop DAO Plugins for [Gnosis Safe](/86cef5db-02ab-4632-ad1d-6141a185f418), [Snapshot](/b24ee33c-b3bb-400e-ac10-fe833a536955), and possibly other DAO Frameworks that will be able to mine the Realm Token 
* Realm Token Design
	* Inital launch (40% pre mint) with minable via social mining with logarithmic decay
	* What the money raised will be used for
		* Develop Question Engine
* The First Seed, ICO Yourself
	* See [Question Engine](/cc5cc49d-f554-4f29-b31a-b8789688e6a3)
* Planting Seeds for Tomorrow
	* Question Engine won't be effective if it is forced on people. It needs to [seduce](/45ae90e1-c4fd-4d7a-b290-a4050b37b573)  them therefore once the core is built out it needs to be modular so it can be re skinned for each communities and individuals needs.
