I am interested in two problems. 

1. How does one put all data they have personally generated into an single accessible API with RBAC(Rule Based Access Control).
2. Once all one's data is all easily queryable what do you do with it?
	1. Ask yourself, what is Data For?
 
 ## What is ETL to Question Engine?

Question Engine is the name I use for the software toolbox I hope to eventually write that will be able to answer these questions.

I came up with the name Question Engine because I realized that having data sitting inside a database is useless unless you can poke and prod it with questions. The Questions one asks can can be broken down into simpler questions that all need to linked together. I think of this linking together of data, generating context, as mimetic sewing. I want a tool so I can perform mimetic sewing on not only my data but my friends, family, coworkers, and community.
