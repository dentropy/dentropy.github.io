title: Stated vs Revealed Preferences
---
#### Research

* [Stated vs Revealed Preferences - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyiE_desGKs)
	* Stated preferences are when you ask people what they want
	* Reveled preference, talk is cheap, you need to see what people actually buy
		* Examples
			* People want to learn a foreign language but don't want to put in the effort
			* People want more public services but don't want to pay more taxes.
* [2024-02-02](../2024-02-02)
	* I state I want to lead a discussion group, I want people to naturally bring up what they find interesting
