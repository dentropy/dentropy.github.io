[I hate how apps make you state your interests and all you get is sports, politics, arts and stuff.](../I hate how apps make you state your interests and all you get is sports, politics, arts and stuff.)

Swipe on Questions just like [TikTok](../ae86ca23-5c89-4852-ae91-f7f46d4494cf) to find the ones you like, actually rate them on whatever scale you want to use.

Any question you select can produce similar questions.

This is the same thing I want to do with all the Discord Data.
