title: Heterophenomenology

Introspection of the other.

Heterophenomenology is a term coined by [Relationships.People.Daniel Dennett](/Daniel Dennett) to describe an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of consciousness and other mental phenomena. It consists of applying the scientific method with an anthropological bent, combining the subjects self-reports with all other available evidence to determine their mental state. The goal is to discover how the subject sees the world him- or herself, without taking the accuracy of the subjects view for granted.
