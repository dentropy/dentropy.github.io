## Logs

* 2023-04-12T16:34:13-04:00
	* So I already have my [Web Scraping Orchestration](/dd43be98-5e8e-45b2-b279-6cfb7474bba9) tool
	* I developed the Web Scraping Orchestration tool in order to ingest a graph of memes
	* I want it to be able to index any wiki, social media, blog, or the tidlyverse
	* I want to be able to go through and label all my links, for example I want to be able to say all links matching this URL pattern are tags, "fictional characters", "fictional", "characters"
	* I want to be able to connect twitter tags and users to fandom sites
