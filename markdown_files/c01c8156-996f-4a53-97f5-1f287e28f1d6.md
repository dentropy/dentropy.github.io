title: Upgrading history on Unix Systems
---
On unix systems, like Linux and MacOS, all commands are logged by default in order in which they were input. These logs can be accessed using the `history` command. To see the time they were logged you can just use arguments such as `-i` or `-E` as displayed below, or you can permanently set an environment variable to include the date when you run `history`

``` bash
history -i
history -E

# Only works for bash, for zsh you will need an alias
HISTTIMEFORMAT="%F %T "
echo "export HISTTIMEFORMAT=\"%F %T \"" >> ~/.bashrc 
source ~/.bashrc 

```
