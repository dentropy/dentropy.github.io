So if we are going to codify the human experience what parts of the world would not fit nicely into these model's

* System Modeling
* Supply Chain
* What about graphs and diagrams
* What about geospatial information
* How does the system understand natural language
* What about infographics
* What about images in general?
  * Image's in general are just a collection of metadata. They are tagged, they have descriptions, they each have a unique position in the meme pool of DID(Decentralized Identitie's)
  * There is Spatial Data and understanding which the above list does not cover
* What about Interactive Systems such as Games?
* What about the image softare that translates the text on images into other languages.
* What about stuff like the concept of quadratic funding?
