``` SQL

select distinct guilds_t.id , guilds_t.guild_name, month_timestamp, msg_count from (
	select
		distinct DATE_TRUNC('day', real_timestamp)
			         AS  month_timestamp,
	    COUNT(guild_id) AS msg_count,
	    guild_id 
	FROM messages_t
	GROUP BY guild_id, month_timestamp
) as month_messages_t
join guilds_t on month_messages_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
order by guilds_t.id, month_timestamp;

```
