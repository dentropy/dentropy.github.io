PKM tools are just apps for taking notes. There are nice ones like [Obsidian](/f76a085e-f2c8-43bd-a852-47760f01e401), [logseq](/e8047586-3985-4caa-9020-b8a5dde09d50), [Trilium Notes](/ac895e08-776c-4f91-86a6-5108e7634d3d) and even [Google Docs](/27b9ed36-0be3-452d-a583-2c850f101989) that I personally really like, but you can always use whatever notes app suits your fancy. One key feature that PKM software has that your notes app probably doesn't is the ability to link and back link links. This means that notes are not only link to other notes but are aware of the notes that link to them.
