## Stacy's First Answer

I would want to use my influence to help make the world a better place. I want to famous for impact I have made. I would like to head a humanitarian project for the UN but use my media and communication skills to work on the cognitive dissonance of wherever I am stationed. I might not be TV famous, but I could eventually publish a book, go on a speaking circuit, and do some interesting consulting. Engine/Pages/discovery - Screen.md#Discovery Screen Example Table]]
