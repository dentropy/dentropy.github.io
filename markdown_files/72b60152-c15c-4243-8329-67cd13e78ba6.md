#### User Stories and Journeys are Key

TL;DR, go check out [Epic User Journeys](../c81f0da9-8d82-4176-8458-cfb3d06924c4)

People are inspired by an [Animated vision of the future](../f5f130bd-59db-4589-8951-d05796340790). So what was my animated vision? If anyone asked me what it was I would just provide talking points such as my, [DDaemon - Two Root Problems](../38fcd810-80ab-4de0-8ad4-9c66da369de3), [Social Media Singularity](../a774c0a5-5e5e-48f9-8ab5-a91eb358c5f4), [Psyop Interrogation Software](../bc513a43-335b-45b6-b323-46c78a688bc8), [Sense Making Apparatus](../5fbf7baa-a842-4ca1-ab0a-36ae66b7a808), and my favorite [Commoditize Context](../6c1a104f-51d8-40ac-bb23-c5768cdbfb16). 

Sadly none of those [memelets](../6b66b19c-139f-4c68-a9e7-2f9b2077d2e1) are visions, in fact they may be more virtue signaling than anything. Stating that I acknowledge, not that I understand... just acknowledge problems that are in vogue. There is no clear vision here besides giving people access to a version of [XKeyscore](../72758d0b-a14b-4afe-a512-5484219cd49d) that only [Souveils](../26a0d433-66a1-4ed0-b353-41939b48acfa) themselves.

A vision has to be tangible, not raw idea abstraction. The vision has to involve [People, Places, and Things](../73c7627a-0f37-48d8-812b-bec2fe39ecdf). A vision has to be told as a story that involves [Tulpas](../b2785ce5-bff0-4c41-baf9-7d9dffe3fabb) that people can empathize with. Think to yourself, how can you explain what a product is without a story. Well I have resurrected my old [Question Engine User Stories](../f137b314-579f-42ab-8be5-1c72bf9ebcd9) and decided on a journey that I will be articulating further in future posts.

1. State That Your Life Has Value
2. Rate Questions you Like or Dislike Tinder Tagging Style
3. Show the user Memelets and require they engage with them
4. Get assigned a quest

#### Tutorials and their Purposes

Writing a little tutorial is a pretty good way to do research. Read the docs, set some sort of goal, develop the simplest POC possible.

If I can't get the example code in the README to work, I don't want to use that software.
