* [FoamTree on touch devices](https://collabhangout.netlify.app/)
  * [Tools for remote teams - Collaboration Superpowers](https://www.collaborationsuperpowers.com/tools/)

Right now I work out of daily.TODO but there are many problems with this workflow. It is missing many features I desire. Like how do I manage my my relationships and family from there, how much detail do I require. I want DentropyDaemon to be able to be able to remind me to call my girlfriend but that is a complicated condition to program in.

How can I have thing dumped into the next week queue and then work on them this week.
