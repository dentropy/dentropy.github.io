title: How do I do Hello World in Ansible?
---
## Step one Install Pip

* [Installing Pip](/Installing Pip)

## Step two, install ansible via pip

``` bash
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```


## Step three, test ansible command

``` bash
ansible -m ping localhost
```

## Step four, add nodes to ansible inventory and test inventory

All the hosts are stored in a configuration file that. So when you want to configure servers you select them from this file and run command form them.

``` bash
sudo mkdir /etc/ansible
cd /etc/ansible
touch hosts
sudo vim hosts
```

Below is an example ansible hosts file, please update the IP address or hostnames to a server you can SSH into.

``` yaml
ungrouped:
  hosts:
    192.168.7.219:
webservers:
  hosts:
    server1.homelab.local:
    server2.homelab.local:
```

To test if ansible is aware of the hosts run the following command

``` bash
ansible-inventory --list -y
```

To test if you can connect to the servers run the following command, changing root for the user you ssh into, make sure you have ssh keys configured, you can learn more about configuring ssh keys at [ssh-copy-id](/caa847b1-c096-4fa0-9df4-0a5fd9839e34).

``` bash
ansible all -m ping -u root 
```

To actually run a command on all the servers and get the result returned you can run something like the following, remember to replace root again

``` bash
# example 1
ansible servers -a "uptime" -u root

# example 2
ansible all -a "df -h" -u root
```

You can run ansible modules, like so

``` bash
ansible all -m apt -a "name=vim state=latest" -u root
```
