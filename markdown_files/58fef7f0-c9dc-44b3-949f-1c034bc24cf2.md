#### Reminders

* [OrbitDB](/OrbitDB)
* We need a way for people to comment on all my user stories and journeys
* I need a way to map files, such as memes ebooks and documents etc, to an ontology
* Produce memelets that have value to others
#### DDaemon Design Prompts

- We need a way to annotate all digital data.
- Imagine multi threaded twitter being produced from my logs, for example I can stream my browsing history when I am researching a specific topic.
- We need a way to collaboratively life log.
- We need a way to communicate our quests.
- If a competent dev can produce a twitter clone by themselves in under a week by themselves whatever replaces twitter should also be able to be done in a week but use a fundamentally different design.
- We need a embedding hub, sure we use CID's to look stuff up but we also need to do embeddings for images and text.
- Where is blockchain twitter, where is blockchain reddit, why haven't people started using these things
