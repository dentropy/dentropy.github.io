So the [Bene Gesserit](../8e284456-7454-4f1d-aff4-9ab9c32f4855) are like over socialized people, the example being those that have sex irrespective of having children, but in a more nuanced sort of way because they view life as a projection on a screen and refuse to feel it.

* [Dune](../24229833-9146-4417-9a5a-0c46fa1efb1a)
The [Social Justice Warriors](../13fdc7a8-d4ec-4eff-9503-339e118635ff), and the honoured Madre in June seem eerily similar

What if the Covid vaccine and virus are like the blood of Seonia from Dune

End Dune each time when there is a scattering such as when the AI does it or when the humans do it in the prequels or when later the second does it or when, depending jess do it it is like a sand worm dying as above so below

The chaos are the telaxu in dune

The way the [Bene Gesserit](../8e284456-7454-4f1d-aff4-9ab9c32f4855) are described as viewing life as a projection and reacting to it reminds me of [Plato's Cave](../f6ba6f77-bcce-4d1c-8094-ca97c37608a9)
The Bene Gesserit did not embrace a little chaos in their system of control. Leto II let randomness into his fish speakers breeding program. [Assume Formlessness](../Assume Formlessness)
