## ddaemon-monorepo

A collection of ETL(Extract Transform Load) tools for taking social media and quantified self data and generating visualizations so people can better understand themselves and others.

## Motivation

Why can't Google index all my data allowing me to search myself? The vision for Dentropy Daemon is to take all ones data into a single extendable API that the user and only the user has access and control over.

## Guide to Bindings and Apps

* Bindings are tools to get and transform data from different sources into a format that can be queried.
* Apps are tools that can be used to interact with the data once the bindings have it in the correct format

## Bindings

* [wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.bindings.keybase](../65f9c304-affc-4dc5-bde9-43994e99b2b9)
  * Export data from keybase and put it in Elasticsearch
* [wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.bindings.discord](../1c376bfd-75ef-4c0d-9e23-3680653de55f)
  * Take exported data from discord and put it into Elasticsearch
* [wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.bindings.git](../c49ff73e-a032-4af0-aada-91f8cc9c19d7)
  * TODO

## Apps

* [wiki.ddaemon.monorepo.app.web](../96e3ea02-9a99-4783-af83-bb7a0ca6e44d)
  * Visualize the data from different bindings




## [dentropydaemon-wiki/Dentropy Daemon/Archive/Monorepo/backlog](../dentropydaemon-wiki/Dentropy Daemon/Archive/Monorepo/backlog)

## Feedback

* Fix the documentation for my project
* Polish
* Additional Charts
* Backend API
* Tell a bit of a story through the data
* User Stories

## General Backlog

* Reference design for backend API
* Start thinking about caching

## Epics

* Reaction type queries
* Multi team/user/topic select
* Messages per hour
* Create API Backend rather than proxying the elasticsearch queries
* Modular Query Builder function (Which can be moved to the backend later)
  * Add team / user select programmatically to each query rather than hard coding it in the JSON
  * Add specific team, user, and topic to query programmatically
  * Get most reactions to a specific message
  * Reply queries
  * Per capita queries
* Finish adding the elasticsearch error response function in all components

## Tech Debt

* Review names for all reducers
* Skim through everything
  * Place better console.logs as comments for later debugging
  * Remove the unused components
* Margin and CSS stuff

## Delete Specific Index

``` bash
source .env
curl -XDELETE -iL -u $ELASTIC_USER:$ELASTIC_PASS "$ELASTIC_NODE/discordguild*"
```

## Discord Binding

* How many users in a guild
* Add scripts for dumping and indexing each separate index
* Get the character count of the contents
* Get the number of attachments, mentions, embeds etc
* Parse out any domain names

## DataViz Backlog

* What about specific user and topic queries
  * A specific user is not going to work because we want to graph the different message types
  * What about their activity across channel's?
  * For this it requires doing an aggregation on a separate field
  * This is worth doing
  * User message types is not going to work
* General search functionality
* Replies Graph
  * Topic's across team
  * User
* Datagrid that can list complete messages
  * Combine the data grid components?
  * Longest
  * Replies
  * Most Reaction's

## Keybase Binding

* Parse Reactions


## Reminders

* [Project Management.ddaemon-webapp.logs](../96e3ea02-9a99-4783-af83-bb7a0ca6e44d)
* Key base Data Ex filtration
* Getting Started with Discord Bot Development
* Rubber Duck Debugging
* Diagram it out
* [Project Management.ddaemon-webapp.User Stories](../0a35a47e-8ad9-42f5-9cdf-cd7842f53db9) BEFORE developing a feature

## Current Task

* REREAD THE USER STORIES
* Review all user stories for the list queries and create a list of tech debt
* Gotta fix the way the reducers values are named for the Query Selector especially for the lists

## Research Notes

* [wiki.software.Catagories.Frontend.Datagrid](../Frontend Datagrid)
* [wiki.software.Catagories.Data Visualization](../dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Data Visualization)

## Design

* [wiki.software.Catagories.Data Visualization](../dentropydaemon-wiki/Software/Software Catagories/Data Visualization)
* Do I want the graph itself to be stored in the context?
* Do I want to store each part of the graph as a separate reducer and use a separate context?
  * Yes but that is over optimization at this point
* Reactions and Replies
  * Do I want to do an aggregation for reactions to a message for slack?
  * First I would have to seach all replies, then I would have to do an aggregation on the specific messages replied to


## Feedback

* Query replies
* Per Capita message types
* URL's per person
* Emoji's sent by specific user distribution
* Emoji's received by specific user
* Graph of who interacts via emoji's
* Time based stuff
* Search across teams
* Who is across multiple teams
* CRM Integration
* Hashtag support
* Completed
  * Who has not posted in X Channel

## Issues

* We want a generalized way to do the elasticsearch queries
  * Why not have a switch statement and for each graph require a specific set of key's
  * This way it will be easy to get the graph title managed here as well
  * I guess this requires a custom component with props, yes it does
  * I need to add a props section to this wiki
* There is not title for the graph
  * Research vega title
* I want to make the sidebar built into the graph render component

## Steps to add a graph

* Create component template
* Requirements
  * Graph name:
  * Graph ID:
* Add component to KeybaseRoot.js
* Add graph radio button to QuerySelect.js
* Add to switch statement in KeybaseRoot.js
* Automatically select Topic and Team in the left sidebar

## Nice to haves

* List users that are accounted for in the other part of the pie chart

## Elastic Keys

* user = msg.sender.username
* topic = msg.channel.topic_name.keyword
* team = msg.channel.name
* Message type = msg.content.type
