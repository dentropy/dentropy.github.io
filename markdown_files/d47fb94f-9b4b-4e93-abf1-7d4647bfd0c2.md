#### TODO

* 

#### we need a cytoscape schema user story

* [DDaemon verses LNBits](../DDaemon verses LNBits)
	* I wanted Obsidian as a Progressive Web App that can be federated across devices ingest data like a memex and have blockchain singularity like RBAC
* App Name,
	* nostr-nip05-server.dentropy@ddaemon.org
* Read levelSchema.md and generate Cytoscape.js elements
	* Describe each query using the elements from cytoscape.js
* Init express server with leveldb data
* Setup script
	* Create IPNS directories
	* Write all GET, UPDATE, and INSERT queries for levelSchema in order that the application will use them
		* Remember every update has to include the following
			* jq command, new_cid, timestamp
			* But some systems don't update a single big file, they have an additional name space like a DNS name, or they have a transaction space
			* We need to map this out
		* Load admin key
		* Load DNS name
			* Configure nostr.json
* Support updating .well-known/nostr.json
* Return .well-known/nostr.json
* Create coupons
* Check coupons
* Claim Coupons
* User can update nostr relays
* User can check how long their identity is valid for
* User can change name on same DNS
* Support multiple domains
	* [Strfry](../Strfry) relay support for those multiple domains
* [Research Paid Nostr Relays](../Research Paid Nostr Relays)
* LNBits tutorial
	* [CAIP-2](../CAIP-2)
* Support purchases
	* Support Topping Up
* Dentropy Daemon "improvement proposals" like [EIP](../f0c854cc-e82f-4e8a-9d77-165bc8bd4b93) or [NIP](../79ef73c3-8e89-4380-9c54-689d8406ec49) or [BIP](../BIP) or [CAIP](../CAIP) which we can call [DDIP](../DDIP)
* TODO Later
	* [Stripe - Software](../Stripe - Software) integration
	* Use [JSONSchema](../ae47732c-10e8-4d3b-b365-9c3902febdfa) in the MVP not the POC
	* Rotating a key
	* Become Paid Nostr Relay
	* Support updating relay via encrypted message sent to relay service
	* [Nostr Import Events Feature](../Nostr Import Events Feature)
	* [Pricing - RelayGuardian](https://relayguardian.com/pricing)
	* Remember to have a reverse CID lookup that are also stored as a CID
	* We need to version the schema and store it in the app_data and stuff
	* Do we want to backlink CIDs
