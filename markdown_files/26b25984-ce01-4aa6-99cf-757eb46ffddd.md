## Ways to measure agency using social media

[Relationships.People.Engerraund Serac](/Serac), a fictional character within [media.list.Westworld](/dentropydaemon-wiki/Media/List/Westworld) season 3, uses this wonderful phrase, bubbles of agency, as a label for individuals in the truest form of the word people who obtain and wield power and yet can not be predicted. John Galt and his friends also have a similar phrase for the same concept, Prime Movers.
