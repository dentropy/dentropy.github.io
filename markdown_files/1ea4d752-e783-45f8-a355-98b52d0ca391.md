## Research

* [What is morphic resonance? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_RGEpJSr6s&t=17s)
	* Morphic resonance is a connection across time from the past to the present. It is a process that occurs between organized patterns of activity on the basis of similarity. What is means is in effect every species has a collective memory.

	* Telepathy
	* Migration Patterns
	* Research Ruper Sheldrake's debates
	* Many skeptics do not have open minds
* [Are you interested in hearing about my experiences? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNe2yD8MfVA)
	* Rupert Sheldrake has a database of people's stories
	* Telephone Telepathy
	* Dogs and Cats can find their owners after their owners leave
	* People may be able find other people similarly where Dogs and Cats find their owners
	* People think of meeting someone and then they appear
* [Habits and Evolution in Nature, Rupert Sheldrake 1983 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUH-wTo_1qM)
	* There is an implicit assumption throughout the whole of science that all the laws of nature of fixed and they were there at the moment of the Big Bang
	* Any experiment ought to be repeatable any time, the implicit is that the laws of nature are the same in all times and all places
	* We assume the stars we look at in the sky broadcasting light from millions of light years away have the exact same laws of nature over there.
	* The fine structure of Carbon look the same now as it did at 1/4 the age of the universe
	* The regularities of natures are more like habits, Carbon's habit is older than 3/4 the age of the universe
	* Law if an anthropocentric metaphor we apply to nature.
	* Animals have habits, only human beings have laws
	* People did not always think the laws of nature were constant, for people Sir Thomas Brown during the 1700's as an example
	* The mind of God has been dissolved away from the world machine
	* Are right angle triangles always have 90 degree angles, is Pi just a habitual ratio between

	* The lines we draw between things such as outside a building and inside a building is much more complicated than one would assume
	* Every species has a collective memory, the collective unconscious
	* Our memories are stored in morphic resonance not the actual neurons.
	* Plato came up with the idea of eternal forms outside space and time governing the laws of nature.
	* Re removed God but still have the idea of Eternal Unchanging Laws
