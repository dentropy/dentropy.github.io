## Honeypots

I just conducted a stupid yet interesting experiment. I found that there was a cryptokitty inside the wallet of a default seedphrase I am using for my development blockchain. I sent some Ethereum to the address of the wallet so I could send the cryptokitty back to myself. Immediately as I sent the Ethereum in someone else performed another transaction claiming my ethereum for themselves. Lesson learned, this also highlights a design flaw with in Ethereum. Since one can not pay for other user transactions publicly available private keys act as, to use a hacking phrase, Honeypot[1]. Another interesting point is that the honeypot operator paid about 8x the gas price to get the transaction through. The current gas price is about 130 GWei the honey pot operator paid over 900 GWei.
