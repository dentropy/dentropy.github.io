## Completed [2023-12-03](/2023-12-03)

* [Research Example Project Roadmaps](/Research Example Project Roadmaps)
* Updated [Backlog - Discord Binding](/dc6a1ac7-60f0-452d-9536-9fed6d92bc51)
	* Updated `ETL Diagram`
		* Don't use JSON tables anymore
		* Neo4J was added
	* Created `Application Dependency Diagram`
* Jupyter Notebook Report I can send people as PDF and HTML
	* Added a bunch of queries
* Reorganized [Questions for Discord Data](/46abc67b-bbe7-4800-82f5-f08d4c457ef0)
* I also made a funny discovery. I have yet to find a really good cypher query I can't do in relational databases on the discord data. But keeping track of all the SQL queries I am writing is getting so complicated that it may make sense to put them in a graph database. I can put all the queries in queries.py into a graph schema that can be used in the frontend to make selecting queries easier.
