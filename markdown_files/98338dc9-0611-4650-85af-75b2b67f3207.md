  rather than a single value

## Types in Hoon

Types are called Molds.
``` lisp

%d   | date
%p   | Ship Name
%r   | Floating Point
%s   | Integer
%t   | Text
%ux  | Hex

```

## Store A Variable and Recast It, Print a Variable

You can not recast variables using themselves, must use another variable name. Aka Things are Typed.

``` lisp

=varname 10

? varname

(%s varname)

(%ux varname)

=varname2 (%ux varname)

? varname2

```

## Store and Print a List

``` list

=testlist [1 2 3 4 5]

? testlist
```

## Write and Run a Function

Run each section at a time.

#TODO Check types going into function

``` lisp

%- add [1 2]

%- max [100 200]

(gth 12 1)

(mul 2 2)

:: Example Function, input a number and increase it by one
=inc |=  [a=@]
       (add 1 a)

:: Can also be written as
=inc |=(a=@ (add 1 a))

(inc 12)

=double |=(a=@ (mul a 2))

(double 12)

```
