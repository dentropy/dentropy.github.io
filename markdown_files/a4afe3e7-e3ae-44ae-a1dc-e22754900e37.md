## Progress on first Report to be Published

I want to be able to generate both a generalised report summarizing all the Discord Guilds I have scraped as well as guild specific reports. Today I created a list of the Queries and Data Visualizations I want to in the generalized report in which can be found in [Questions to Answer in General Report to Compare Discord Guilds](/0c4bbdac-febf-4e8e-861f-c36ef88a71c9).

I need data sorted and in a specific format before I can fit it into [Plotly](/undefined) the [Data Visualization](/ef29cab3-4aef-413f-b603-29cfeedd290d) software I am currently using inside a [jupyter](/14b19809-58b0-44c8-a719-c50badebb08c) notebook. I have been tempted to resolve SQL queries then use python to synthasize the data into the order and format I need for [Plotly](/undefined) but instead I decided to do as much in SQL. I decided to do as much in SQL as possible because it will later allow me to possibly choose a different programming language from python for my backend, such as JavaScript, Go, Java, or Rust.

I also made an interesting discovery today using [Plotly to produce multiple lines on a line chart](https://plotly.com/python/line-charts/). Turns out you can simply have one a dataframe with one column for labels, one for the timestamp, and one for the whatever value I want. I just point plotly at the right column on the dataframe and I don't need to think about parsing the data in any way myself.
