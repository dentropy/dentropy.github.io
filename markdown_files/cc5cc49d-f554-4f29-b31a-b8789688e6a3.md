I get a good feeling when someone asks me an interesting question. I hate it when I have an enlightening conversation with interesting questions and insights but can't remember the specifics of the conversation the next day. I often find bursts of inspiration that work for a time but then collapse when I become overwhelmed with complexity. I often find myself lost in life and feel if I had the right set of questions I could effectively orient myself. I hope to build Quest(ion) Engine so I can have an environment to get to know myself.
## Initial Description

The general goal of Quest(ion) Engine to have a RPG quest engine for real life just like in [Daemon by Daniel Suarez](/96e5b489-1dc8-47ed-a058-25ac9da1cd40). Quests are arrived at by asking questions, Quest(ion) Engine provides the medium for this cognition. The mediums we use to consume data on our computers today don't capture the metadata context behind the decisions people make. Why does someone choose to consume one video over another? How much information does an emoji reaction to a message really have? Are people self censoring because they do not have easy to use fine grained permissions on the information they share? The medium is the message, Quest(ion) Engine hopes to define the message built into the mediums we use to communicate by first creating a system for RBAC Socratic dialog.

Quest(ion) Engine uses **[Personas](/7bde7781-e2c6-4229-84d8-057eb0fc58fa)** rather than *accounts*. To "wield a persona" you use "[metamask](/undefined)", a interface to the the many masks one can wield and display to the world. To wield a mask you must first "state that your life has value" by minting your own token and turning on a faucet so others mint your token to interact with you. Every post you or someone makes has to have a token attached to it. Your faucet has settings so you can control how people manipulate your attention for example, a faucet can only work every 20 minutes and give out only 4 tokens each time. When you interact with someone you must first use their faucet. Once you have their token you can spend it to reveal their answers to questions, reveal questions that are not publicly displayed on their profile, or send them a direct message. When interacting with yourself and others communication is contextualised by meme types such as questions and statements, this medium encourages people to structure their thoughts. This is useful because when you are now having a conversation you can attach tokens to different parts of the meme graph to signal where people should regulate their attention. This also allows someone create a persona, mint their own token, allocate it throughout the meme graph adding their own edges (links) and stuff. The goal of Question Engine is to provide people not only a tool that they can speak through but a tool they can think through.

## Proof of Concept

We develop a game of Q&A similar to what [OK Cupid](/85eda353-9816-4f81-8959-65382bf93698) has. The question and answers in OK Cupid worked by requiring you yourself answer a question before you were allowed to see the answers of other people. This core concept is valuable but needs to be meddled with because [a Math Genius hacked this system ti get tones of 100% matches](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/). Dating apps don't really support multiplayer, you don't necessarily have three people meeting up to go on a date. The core value of the share your answer to see mine play mechanic works because "work" has to be done to answer the question.

Well what if we created a game where we had a question protocol and you gave any of your verified followers X tokens they could use to see your answers to different publicly viewable questions. There could also be follow up responses that also consume these tokens. And tagged questions that also cost tokens. In order to get more tokens the user has to give them to you. The tokens are soul bound and attached to a NFT.


## The First Question

"What are we to do with our lives" is a very interesting question we should each try and answer. Everyone has a subconscious reason for existing but none of us really articulate it. Understanding and articulating one's life purpose is difficult. We all want multiple things and whatever action we make towards one want places the other wants in a different location. Many of us don't even know what we want and need some help from others figuring that out. Through Quest(ion) Engine one can wield a Persona and have deep permissioned dialog with other Personas. Hopefully after enough structured dialog everyone will find meaningful questions specific enough so that they turn into quests.
