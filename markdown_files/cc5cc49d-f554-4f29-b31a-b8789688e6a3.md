## Initial Description

I call the project Quest(ion) Engine. The general goal is to have a RPG quest engine for real life just like in [Daemon by Daniel Suarez](/96e5b489-1dc8-47ed-a058-25ac9da1cd40). The first key feature is the use of Persona's rather than accounts, and to "wield a persona" you use "[metamask](/undefined)". The first thing you do when you login is "state that your life has value" by minting your own token while turning on a faucet so others mint your token to interact with you. Every post you or someone makes has to have a token attached to it, though this is not a problem because transactions and tokens are almost free. (Faucet's only work once every 20 min by default and release 4 tokens) When you interact with someone you must first use their faucet. Then when interacting with them communication is contextualised by meme types such as questions and statements. This is useful because when you are now having a conversation you can attach tokens to different parts of the meme graph to signal where people should regulate their attention. This also allows someone create a persona, mint their own token, allocate it throughout the meme graph adding their own edges (links) and stuff. But there is no value in a system like this if everything is public like with twitter. The real world is a "dark forest" where you can see strangers, acquaintances, coworkers, friends and enemies but you don't know them deeply. Each user can have a series of public questions and statements on their profile that people can unlock via spending their token or possibly more complex transactions. For example the question "What is my favourite movie?" can be public but the users answer will require you use their faucet, get their token, and spend it to find out.

## Proof of Concept

We develop a game of Q&A similar to what [OK Cupid](/85eda353-9816-4f81-8959-65382bf93698) has. The question and answers in OK Cupid worked by requiring you yourself answer a question before you were allowed to see the answers of other people. This core concept is valuable but needs to be meddled with because [a Math Genius hacked this system ti get tones of 100% matches](https://www.wired.com/2014/01/how-to-hack-okcupid/). Dating apps don't really support multiplayer, you don't necessarily have three people meeting up to go on a date. The core value of the share your answer to see mine play mechanic works because "work" has to be done to answer the question.

Well what if we created a game where we had a question protocol and you gave any of your verified followers X tokens they could use to see your answers to different publicly viewable questions. There could also be follow up responses that also consume these tokens. And tagged questions that also cost tokens. In order to get more tokens the user has to give them to you. The tokens are soul bound and attached to a NFT.


## The First Question

"What are we to do with our lives" is a very interesting question we should each try and answer. Everyone has a subconscious reason for existing but none of us really articulate it. Understanding and articulating one's life purpose is difficult. We all want multiple things and whatever action we make towards one want places the other wants in a different location. Many of us don't even know what we want and need some help from others figuring that out. Through Quest(ion) Engine one can wield a Persona and have deep permissioned dialog with other Personas. Hopefully after enough structured dialog everyone will find meaningful questions specific enough so that they turn into quests.
