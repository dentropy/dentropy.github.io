## Use Input Output Redirection

*   `Less` can be used to view files similar to cat
*   `>` can output a text into a file
*   `>>` if exists append to a file
*   `<` is like accepting input
*   `2> and 2>>` if error output that as well
*   `2>&1` Output working command to terminal
*   One can output to `dev/null` for death of the output
*   `chmod u+x` Use this cause it limits use to a specified user
*   `head` see first 10 lines of a file
*   `tail` last 10 lines of a file
