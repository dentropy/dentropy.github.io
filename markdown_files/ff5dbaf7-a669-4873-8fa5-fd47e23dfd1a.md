* What is this Group?
	* e/acc Effective Accelerationisim is a reaction to effective altruism
	* Let's walk confidently into the future rather than trying to regulate everything because we are scared. AI may have growing pains, but so did the industrial revolution.
	* Accelerationisim encourages Building, Using and Testing rather than regulating
	* I want to build stuff and to do that I need to learn
	* The best way to learn is by teaching
	* I want to inspire people to build stuff and in return have them inspire me
* What are we building?
	* Build Agents to read and talk about and compare text such as documents, books, and even social media information
* Who am I
	* [What is your name?](../What is your name?)
		* Paul Mullins
	* [What do you use AI for already?](../What do you use AI for already?)
		* Help write code
		* Talk with Documents
	* [What do we want to use AI for?](../What do we want to use AI for?)
		* Manage my relationships with other people, for example the AI can be like you liked hanging out with person X you should message them
	* [What do you want to build or are currently building?](../What do you want to build or are currently building?)
		* CGFS, a way to cryptographically log in a privacy preserving way
* So Accelerationisim
	* [What future do we want?](../What future do we want?)
	* What do we want to do once we have ASI(Artificial Super Intelligence)?
	* Who here wants to live in a future like Star Trek?
	* If AGI is achieved what role should AI have in raising our children?
	* Should we give people basic income or a humanoid robot that can make money for them?
	* Do you want to live in the matrix but have control over your own simulation?
	* How do we avoid humanity becoming a parasite on the new sudo intelligent systems that will inherit the earth? Parasites survive off other organisms and therefore don't need complex organs like eyes, brains, and ears that are used to survive in a complex environment.
	* I encourage those interested to stay after the workshop to discuss this over some tea.

* Where are we Going?
