title: What is the average half life of top x% active users?

[What is the average half life of a user in a discord guild?](/What is the average half life of a user in a discord guild?)

How do we want to visualize this?

Do we have to use percentage?

It is way easier with percentage.
## Single Guild SQL Query

need percentage updated inside, see "Percentage" comment to find correct line

**Note you can also update the minimum message threshold, see "min_message_length" comment**

``` SQL
SELECT 
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	guilds_t.id,
	EXTRACT(DAY FROM average_author_half_life) as average_author_half_life,
	average_author_half_life as average_author_half_life_timestamp
from
(
	select 
		guild_id,
		avg(author_half_life) as average_author_half_life
	from
	(
		select 
			guild_message_count_t.guild_id as guild_id,
			guilds_t.guild_name,
			msg_count,
			max_msg_timestamp,
			min_msg_timestamp,
			max_msg_timestamp - min_msg_timestamp as author_half_life
		from 
		(
			select * FROM
				(
					select 
						guild_id,
						author_id,
						count(content) as msg_count,
						max(msg_timestamp) as max_msg_timestamp,
						min(msg_timestamp) as min_msg_timestamp
					from messages_t
					group by guild_id, author_id
				) as msg_something_t
			where msg_count > 2 -- min_message_length
			and guild_id = (select id from guilds_t limit 1 offset 0)
		) as guild_message_count_t
		join guilds_t on guild_message_count_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
		order by author_half_life desc
		limit (
			select cast(  cast(author_count as float) / 100 * 30 as Integer) -- Percentage
				as percentage_msg_count
			from 
			(
				select guild_id, COUNT(*) as author_count FROM
					(
						select 
							guild_id,
							author_id,
							count(content) as msg_count
						from messages_t
						group by guild_id, author_id
					) as msg_something_t
				where msg_count > 2 -- min_message_length
				and guild_id = (select id from guilds_t limit 1 offset 0)
				group by guild_id
			) as author_count_t
		)
	)  as avg_halflife_percentage_author_t
	group by guild_id
) as average_author_half_list
join guilds_t on guilds_t.id = average_author_half_list.guild_id

```


## SQL Query

This query will return the message count  and the time between the authors first and last post

``` SQL
select 
	guild_message_count_t.guild_id,
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	msg_count,
	max_msg_timestamp,
	min_msg_timestamp,
	max_msg_timestamp - min_msg_timestamp as author_half_life
from 
(
	select * FROM
		(
			select 
				guild_id,
				author,
				count(content) as msg_count,
				max(real_timestamp) as max_msg_timestamp,
				min(real_timestamp) as min_msg_timestamp
			from messages_t
			group by guild_id, author 
		) as msg_something_t
	where msg_count > 20
	and guild_id = (select id from guilds_t limit 1 offset 0)
) as guild_message_count_t
join guilds_t on guild_message_count_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
order by author_half_life asc;

```

## SQL Query

This query has the author count so we can calculate percentage

``` SQL
select 
	guild_message_count_t.guild_id,
	guilds_t.guild_name,
	msg_count,
	max_msg_timestamp,
	min_msg_timestamp,
	max_msg_timestamp - min_msg_timestamp as author_half_life,
	author_count.author_count
from 
(
	select * FROM
		(
			select 
				guild_id,
				author,
				count(content) as msg_count,
				max(real_timestamp) as max_msg_timestamp,
				min(real_timestamp) as min_msg_timestamp
			from messages_t
			group by guild_id, author 
		) as msg_something_t
	where msg_count > 20
	and guild_id = (select id from guilds_t limit 1 offset 0)
) as guild_message_count_t
join guilds_t on guild_message_count_t.guild_id = guilds_t.id
join (
	select guild_id, COUNT(*) as author_count FROM
		(
			select 
				guild_id,
				author,
				count(content) as msg_count,
				max(real_timestamp) as max_msg_timestamp,
				min(real_timestamp) as min_msg_timestamp
			from messages_t
			group by guild_id, author 
		) as msg_something_t
	where msg_count > 20
	and guild_id = (select id from guilds_t limit 1 offset 0)
	group by guild_id
) as author_count on author_count.guild_id = guild_message_count_t.guild_id
order by author_half_life asc;

```

We have a problem because we can't use Author Count to do the limit unless it is a subquery
