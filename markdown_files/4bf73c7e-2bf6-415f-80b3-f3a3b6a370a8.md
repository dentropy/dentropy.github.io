## Wrote Analytics Class

commit: bcb9a32a90d589b45fcc7ac4f8747907a3b38ea6

Up until now I have been doing the SQL queries inside the [jupyter](/14b19809-58b0-44c8-a719-c50badebb08c) notebook that was also rendering the graphs. My default database has 73 Discord Guilds and about 26 million messages. This has resulted in some queries taking over a minute. It is also not pretty when you have all that SQL code blocks in between the pretty graphs. The DiscordAnalytics class can perform all the nessesary analytics and output them as a [pandas](/7326b865-6598-4839-bafa-4af8174b0b27) DataFrame that can both be saved so it queries do not need to be run again as well as fed into [plotly](/undefined) easily.
