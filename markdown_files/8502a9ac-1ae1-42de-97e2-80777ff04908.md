## Logs

* [2023-04-02](/undefined)
	* 2023-04-02T22:56:59-04:00
		* Alright what's next?
		* We need to create a schema with ORM
		* That's done
		* Then we need to dump data into it and query stuff
		* Crap we should use a better example then
		* Dictionary
		* How about tasks with log
		* Sure
	* 2023-04-02T23:04:56-04:00
		* We need example apps with sqlalchemy
	* 2023-04-03T00:14:01-04:00
		* Did not find those example apps but I got what I wanted up and running
		* What did you get up and running
		* I got the select and join queries working
		* Are we comfortable writing SQLAlchemy ORM for Web Scraping
		* YES
		* Let's do it
* [2023-04-01](/undefined)
	* 2023-04-01T02:38:21-04:00
		* Alright so what do we do next?
		* Well do we do raw table creation or ORM stuff
		* Raw is better to start with
	* 2023-04-01T02:49:00-04:00
		* Alright what directory can we assume we are going to run everything
		* We should probably run it from the main directory
		* Otherwise we need to change the scripts
		* Paul you need to make a decision
		* Main directory
		* Should everything be in its own folders?
		* Then we are path fucked
		* Dude just do your thing
	* 2023-04-01T03:36:58-04:00
		* It looks like the proper SQL select for SQL Alchemy does not work unless ORM
	* 2023-04-01T06:32:04-04:00
		* Dam I did it, we are done
		* Wrote an entire sqlite tutorial
		* Well the code content the format is complete crap
		* So what other tutorials should I do
