#### Features


#### Questions

#### Problems

* How about doing a reverse image search on these images

#### Interrorgation

* I personally upload my meme directory
* I can now share my memes with all my friends
* But sharing all my memes at once is sorta useless, I need to produce context
* I want to export an Ontology of concepts from my PKMS that I can use to connect with the memes
* So what you link [Do-ocracy](/c90f0fbc-fe9d-4182-8582-19c5c105c848) to the concept of [Do-ocracy](/c90f0fbc-fe9d-4182-8582-19c5c105c848) that is no utility in that
* Like bro you can also generate all those images
* [Question everything, find truth, and don't forget to check your premises](/Question everything, find truth, and don't forget to check your premises)
* [Thoughts/List/Interrogate Everything](/Thoughts/List/Interrogate Everything)
* I am supposed to use this tagging medium in order to extract my values, model of the world, make my memes searchable, talk to all my memes.
* Alright why have you not done this yet?
* I have no real excuse.
