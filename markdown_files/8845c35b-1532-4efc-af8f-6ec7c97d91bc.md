	* Give people context for why you are asking your questions

	* Rather than ask "Do you use google to search online", ask "How do you do research online"
	* Have an hypothesis for your objective
	* Example Objective

		* DO you have any further questions?
	* Ask "Can we follow up with you?" at the end
