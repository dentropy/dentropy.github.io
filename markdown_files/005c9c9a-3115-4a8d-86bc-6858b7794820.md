title: How are meme's supposed to be linked to one another so they don't get lost?
---
* The problem of meme edges also has a [KISS](../8412af19-c492-44c7-8e39-7fad1b85155e) solution. Just like how in [Roam Research](../6c6425a5-d844-46fd-ba26-8d0fa23ce07a) you must link a note a single other note in order to save it, a meme must link to another meme in order for it to be processed by Question Engine. Worrying about any additional complexity such as modeling the data structure of a thread in a meme makes things much too complicated.
