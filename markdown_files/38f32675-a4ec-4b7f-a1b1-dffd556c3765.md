To understand what an Egregore is you first need to understand what a [Tulpa](../07b300d6-954f-4c14-9b4d-c60419b1d4e5) is

## Tulpa Definition


## Definition

Egregores don’t necessarily map onto humans. Rather than a hard-and-fast distinction, it’s more helpful to think of tulpas as a subtype of egregores, perhaps of the highest intensity.

## Contextualising

Tulpa's map onto people while Egregores are persona's that can be mapped to just about anything.

This reminds me of how [Yuval Noah Harari](../Yuval Noah Harari) talks about the Animalist religions in [Sapiens](../816c0ab2-1934-4642-89fd-1bc1edd96961).
