title: The Rolling Key Problem
---
## Description of Rolling Key Problem

When dealing with Blockchain wallets like [MetaMask](../037fca47-315e-46e3-a9f0-fc5dbc3ca4ef) the private key inside the wallet can manage 100's of separately managed assets. Each of these assets needs a separate transaction in order to be controlled by another private key. This issue induces friction for the user to roll their keys. Rolling your keys is a security practice where a users generates a new private key, uses their old public/private key to sign their new public key so people know who they are, and then deletes their old private key. This is a good security practice as the more devices our [mnemonic](../12d95a7f-52e7-4d21-8284-85a8049b9398) touches increases the surface area to attackers. Migrating all assets from one controlling private key to another should be as simple as sending a single one of those assets from the original private/public key to another private/public key.

## Background

In the world of [PGP](../5df9b58c-313a-42ac-a127-c48bcb1d8bcb) everyone states the date that their private/public key is going to be destroyed as part of their named signature. Destroying your private keys after a specific date in order to avoid persecution is a good security practice that blockchain fails to support.
