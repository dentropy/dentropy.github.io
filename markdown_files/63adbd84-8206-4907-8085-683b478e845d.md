title: What is the third thing someone should do on Question Engine?
---
The key commodity of Question Engine is [Memelets](/6b66b19c-139f-4c68-a9e7-2f9b2077d2e1). What I want to do with Question Engine is to get people to produce [Memelets](/6b66b19c-139f-4c68-a9e7-2f9b2077d2e1) and use them in their life. 

Expose People to Memelets with a Bias on Quests.

Show off the Quests Completed by other people.

[I dislike how people I know send me a list of memes as direct messages then when they are sitting down with me in person they make me watch each one individually on their phone.](/I dislike how people I know send me a list of memes as direct messages then when they are sitting down with me in person they make me watch each one individually on their phone.)
