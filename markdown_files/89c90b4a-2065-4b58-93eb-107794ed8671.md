#### Reflection + Rant

Intelligence is just breaking down problems into doable chunks. I have completed the first step of the [Original Roadmap](../8d4d461f-49f7-4dbd-829f-807d0bb602df) via my [Discord Analytics Reports and Dashboard](../Discord Analytics Reports and Dashboard). Now I am onto the second phase, [Graph Based Annotation on Top of Discord Data](../Graph Based Annotation on Top of Discord Data).

I have been twiddling my thumbs for months waiting for the right strike of inspiration to proceed to phase two, [Graph Based Annotation on Top of Discord Data](../Graph Based Annotation on Top of Discord Data). My initial plan was to implement a user model by just writing some SQL or use a [ORM](../fe6d5adf-ced3-425a-88eb-a5645db9ced4) like [Prisma](../8538f5cb-5d7c-44ff-9e1e-b4b512ba4f5e) or [SQLAlchemy](../3d3db79a-ae22-4620-8516-5cec289c31c3). Have users create an account using [OAuth](../840bb155-6d8b-4e85-8740-c7b250fc7d65), [Email](../ee10d3a4-1249-412c-a6eb-cd8efbcb3978), or [MetaMask](../037fca47-315e-46e3-a9f0-fc5dbc3ca4ef) then add in the features for the user journeys I have outlined in [Epic User Journeys](../c81f0da9-8d82-4176-8458-cfb3d06924c4). The first user journey would be to add tags then then add features for rankings, comments, and links to the web such as wikipedia and linkedin.

I was unable to break down the task. Here are some thoughts that were going through my head. I attended a hackathon six months back and getting email setup was a bitch, using gmail, Microsoft, or protonmail. Then you sign up for a email [SAAS](../Acronyms/SAAS) offering and they have some convoluted API. Then there was the OAuth option, having to manage a Google API key just goes against my entire ethos of [Self Hosting](../8c26192d-c62a-49c6-be98-d31a38f9633b). Once I see a self hosted app requires an API key for some service of some kind I suddenly don't want to deploy it. Having a separate database, sure no problem just update the [docker-compose](../8c76dc5d-4b41-4c5b-b856-14766d517de1), want to be fancy and use object storage, sure just add [minio](../56cdc9d1-1ef0-4dd8-93d2-70c14b0716a5) to the [docker-compose](../8c76dc5d-4b41-4c5b-b856-14766d517de1). Setting up a domain name with [TLS](../017fa480-0484-452c-9144-3b34b3ad6c37) then getting a whatever OAuth [API](../793811ec-3199-4709-9291-c06229e022f1) Key or whatever you need.... Pardon my french but fuck that. I understand that if this project gets users and possibly funding email and OAuth may need to be implemented but what if there was a way to build up from a more fundamental authentication model.

Well the Authentication and User model are inherently linked. I am afraid of committing to some custom user model in an ORM or SQL due to my inability to easily understand the user model used in my favorite open source projects. I don't understand what [Django](../03e5fa8e-39f5-481b-a040-178350596d13) is doing under the hood, [Jellyfin](../1a9e08bc-d62b-4b71-b8cd-2934244f03eb) does IDK what, I check out [Immich](../20305bf4-fd35-473e-9ff7-f4aed64c3ca5) and I get [this](https://github.com/immich-app/immich/tree/81cf653752a5dfcd6c619e97d96a1b6b718b54eb/server/src/infra/migrations) monstrosity, [wikijs](../c7f4916b-aecb-4d00-a8e3-bb4908e1158d) has [this](https://github.com/requarks/wiki/tree/b1e1759f254b172069849fa858c7923c8da0f415/server/db/migrations) monstrosity.

* [AdGuard](../9b38e17e-4959-4c24-829a-8880e9c77017) = Uses System Logs not SQL
* For more check out [Research - Schema Comparisons](../Research - Schema Comparisons)

Wouldn't it be cool if all these systems were built in raw SQL and used [PRQL](../cce82b1d-c9ad-44f0-a748-c17c0ab69b3d). Actually there might be something to this.

* People do not use [PRQL](../cce82b1d-c9ad-44f0-a748-c17c0ab69b3d) because it is not SQL Database Agnostic like ORMs
	* I bet that could be figured out
* Whatever custom solution on top of PRQL is going to have to be written in some programming language everyone is not going to agree on
	* PRQL is written in Rust, as long as bindings can be made and it has a good [CLI](../9b23ae27-ea5d-4cce-a7f5-f16a47705fdd) like [curl](../912eb5e4-af7d-43c5-aa96-3c5254e63fe6) I doubt this would be a problem.
* This is yet another case of the [Standards XKCD](../Standards XKCD)
	* The ORM SQL Library space does not have standards, every programming language has multiple ways of interacting with databases
* PRQL is just supposed to be used for migrations and schema setup, the actual application can connect to the database however they want.
* Actually can PRQL reverse engineer the schema migration by looking at two separate schema dumps?
	* I bet there is a [LLM](../8098d812-cde1-4a26-ac6f-793f02067948) [Langchain](../b59efdb4-f9de-4ece-8d57-26b06b7c7dfc) system that can help with this.
* If you are supporting multiple database backends you either need to stay within the requirements of all 3 or specialize such as how wikijs 3.0 will support only postgres
* DuckDB has connectors to all 3 databases which I hope would make stuff simpler.
* [Is JSON support different between DuckDB and SQLite?](../Is JSON support different between DuckDB and SQLite?)

Well it now seems like I have a bunch of research topics rather than features to build. The topics are as follow?

* [What jsonschema format can be used for a meme data type that is compatible with most existing social media and extendable?](../What jsonschema format can be used for a meme data type that is compatible with most existing social media and extendable?)
* [How do different open source projects user models differ?](../How do different open source projects user models differ?)
* [What is the best browser extensions and or wallets for signing data?](../What is the best browser extensions and or wallets for signing data?)

Three questions, that's good enough any more and the task of sorting becomes convoluted. You can not answer each of these before having to worry about anything else.
