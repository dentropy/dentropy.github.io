## Reflection on PlayToEarn

Each PlayToEarn game takes an already existing gaming genre, or combination there of, and augments it with the Blockchain.

NFT in these games are relatively interesting because rather than in game auction houses we have global blockchain marketplaces for items.

The DAO integration with PlayToEarn games has got me confused. I can't tell what anyone is marketing about.
