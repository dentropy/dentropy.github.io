Just spit balling here, don't take this too serious

When I hired a dating coach I was learning how to be empathetic when I realized that "Don't rape" is an Axiom for society. Don't rape is something that can be communicated and understood with little to no language.

Another axiom is "One can barter with the future by sacrificing in the present". In the seventh rule of [media.list.12 Rules For Life](/undefined) is "Pursue what is meaningful not what is expedient". In this chapter [Relationships.People.Jordan Peterson](/undefined) starts of simple. For example, sharing one's Mammoth meat in the present with other hunters will share with you when you can't catch something to eat was a concept built into us though natural selection.
