## Logs

* 2023-07-07T11:52:12-04:00
	* Mechanical Turk on Bitcoin
	* Scrape social media for Satoshis
* 2023-06-11T17:49:21-04:00
	* Bounty Platfrom
	* Snapshot and Gnosis Safe have Plugins
* 2023-06-11T02:46:37-04:00
	* Alright Paul, you have failed today
	* What did I fail
	* You could not constrain yourself
	* Remember value comes from constraints
	* You need to explore and fix the unknowns
	* You have to ARTICULATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING! BEFORE YOU FUCKING DO IT!
	* You don't just go write a white paper in an afternoon, well you can, but you can't write a good one
	* Shit I did not do my tik tok today
	* Paul you are functionally dying, you are like Alistair Spiritually
		* You know what that is a good excuse to write`
* 2023-06-11T01:39:42-04:00
	* I have no fucking flow after coming back from that writers group thing
	* Dude you followed in the steps you normally do, Get excited about a project, get started on it, forget about the constraints, start masturbating to how important you think you care, get overwhelmed by the complexity, move to next project
	* Shit that's exactly what is happening, I HAVE ZERO CONSTRAINTS
	* Yes, you have zero constriants
	* Why don't you just keep developing question engine rather than working on this which has like no scope
	* Well I should be using this project as a test case for Question Engine
	* So you going to keep cracking your head on this or are you going to do something useful about it
	* Hmmmmm I wana masturbate
	* Alright go ahead, fuck it
* 2023-06-10T23:33:13-04:00
	* Let's go back and understand the Realm token strategy overview
	* 
* 2023-06-10T22:55:14-04:00
	* Dude your white paper is going to quote H.G.Wells
	* Yes, it's nice and edgey
	* Ya no this is a clear paper
* 2023-06-10T22:33:39-04:00
	* We need a better map of white papers
* 2023-06-10T22:31:43-04:00
	* Alright Paul what do you want each part of the document to question
	* Alright looks like we need an outline
* 2023-06-10T22:19:01-04:00
	* Alright what's next?
	* Dude just read what you write
	* When you are done record yourself reading it out loud
	* Then iterate
	* Alright read what?
* 2023-06-10T16:16:37-04:00
	* We got our DAO projects
	* But I can't judge them accurately
	* No one is there to help you Paul, unless you tell them what you want
	* You need to prompt people like you prompt ChatGPT
	* Tell the universe exactly what you fucking want
* 2023-06-10T16:00:55-04:00
	* What do we need?
	* Well let's start writing it
	* We need a plan though
	* Let's get some requirements
	* I need to get some DAO white papers in the list
* 2023-06-10T15:56:47-04:00
	* OODA - O
		* I wana write an entire white paper
		* I just when and got a bunch of descriptions of white papers
	* Orient
		* I should use my master thread
			* Give people a tool they can not only speak through but think through
	* Decide
		* Ya I like that tweet
	* Observe
		* I need to log this in the project
* [2022-12-06](/undefined)
	* Now what
		* We do a sinature message verification example
		* Then we do all the typescript types
		* Then we decide what schema we want for a database
		* Alright signature time
	* We got the signature examples done
		* I remember they have an extra 20 bytes in front of their message, I don't think we need to store it though
	* Where are our types we need to generate
		* Below
	* Aren't there example types for addresses and stuff?
		* [TypeChain/types.ts at master Â· dethcrypto/TypeChain](https://github.com/dethcrypto/TypeChain/blob/master/packages/typechain/src/typechain/types.ts)
		* Well we probably want a list to store the transactions rather than an object with stuff
[2022-11-30](/undefined)
* Let's verify those signatures
[2022-11-28](/undefined)
* Next Steps
	* Preactice doing actualy signatures
	* Verify message of siganture
	* Document the signature block types
	* Create Typescript types for each signature blocks
	* Boot a user signature chain
* Wrote out the user stories
* Let's scope out the compotnents
	* Create Gnosis Safe Treasury
	* Booting signature chain from Gnosis Safe
		* Point script at safe and get all the signatures
		* Booting signature data structure, we are going to need signature types
		* Type 0 - Link Gnosis Safe
			* Contract Address: address
			* ChainID: int
			* MemberAddQuarum: int
			* Number of booting users: int
			* List of booting users: []
			* Unix Time: bigint
			* Who is Signing: address
			* HASH, SIG
			* Admin Signing Time:
		* Type 1 - Add Safe Member
			* Who is Signing: address
			* Unix_time
			* HASH, SIG
		* Type 2 - Add community member
			* Unix_time
			* AdminSigList: []
		* Type 3 - Set Name
			* Unix_time
			* Address
			* Name
			* HASH, SIG
	* User signature chain
	* Media signature chain
	* Momments and metadata signature chain
* Let's scope out the first component, booting signature chain from gnosis safe
	* Have a Gnosis Safe
	* Read the addresses from a gnosis safe
	* Generate the signature chain
		* What message does everyone sign
		* Doing Gnosis Safe metadata is identifiable enough
		* How do we name the addresses
		* The order they came in of course
		* Then we can have a username setting part of the signature chain
	* How do we deal with number of people
		* That is part of the metadata
	* What metadata do we want
	* What do I need to know
		* How to read the required members in a safe
	* getOwners() from  base/OwnerManager.sol is the file we are looking for
	* Let's get the ABI for the Gnosis Safe
	* What is the contract address now?
		* https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments/blob/main/src/assets/v1.3.0/gnosis_safe.json
	* Wow that could not be easier
	* Alright we can now pull the owners from a safe
	* 
* Thinking
	* Do we need the signatures from the gnosis safe or do we just read who the owners currently are
	* How do we deal with the owners being updated
	* How do we deal with the owner of the safe changing without having to update the signature chain
	* Do we just require that everyone accepting the new block check the blockchain to see if it was changed
	* All owners are going to post time stamped signatures
	* If someone finds a transaciton hash for the change of owners that is within time constriants then the signature chain is reverted
	* Well the system can get out of date, when the owners change someone just says the owners changed and signs a block of all the new owners. Doesn't matter. No it does matter because those owners are managing new users. The users need to be watching the owner's.
	* What about everyone adding a new signature of the owners
	* We do not sign it, we just have a sorted list of the users updated with the time.
	* No we can have the owners update it themselves
	* For every user added the people need to check if the gnosis safe is still the same as the contract
	* Reject the new users otherwise
	* The people need to rekey after a safe change
	* Rekeying is good opsec, rekey the safe, rekey the DAO
	* The concept that the people in control of the safe and the people managing the community can be different.
	* Alright what do we want to do next?
	* We are going to have to regenerate the same addresses as metamask for testing purposes
	* Alight we are generating the same addresses via the mnemonic
	* And we not have the same 5 accounts
	* I guess we can create a 5 member safe, 2 quaum
	* We have a Gnosis Safe, 0x6840C52be978Bcae50A8f43d814c498d6e380946
	* Test the script
	* Works
	* How do we deal with adding and emoving the admins
	* Oh we have the time solution, the admins need to reconnect every X days
